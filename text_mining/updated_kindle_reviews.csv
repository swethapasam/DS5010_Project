B000F83SZQ,I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.,5
B000F83SZQ,"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.",4
B000F83SZQ,"This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language.",4
B000F83SZQ,I'd never read any of the Amy Brewster mysteries until this one..  So I am really hooked on them now.,5
B000F83SZQ,"If you like period pieces - clothing, lingo, you will enjoy this mystery.  Author had me guessing at least 2/3 of the way through.",4
B000F83SZQ,A beautiful in-depth character description makes it like a fast pacing movie. It is a pity Mr Merwin did not write 30 instead only 3 of the Amy Brewster mysteries.,4
B000F83SZQ,"I enjoyed this one tho I'm not sure why it's called An Amy Brewster Mystery as she's not in it very much. It was clean, well written and the characters well drawn.",4
B000F83SZQ,"Never heard of Amy Brewster. But I don't need to like Amy Brewster to like this book. Actually, Amy Brewster is a side kick in this story, who added mystery to the story not the one resolved it. The story brings back the old times, simple life, simple people and straight relationships.",4
B000FA64QO,"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.",2
B000FA64QO,Great book couldn't put it down.  The story expands events in the new Jedi order series.  Good writer in Walter Jon Williams.,5
B000FA64QO,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids, to the extent that some are viewed as ""Jacen books"" or ""Jania books."" The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.",4
B000FA64QO,I was hoping to find this one in book form. The story looks like it will be good when I get that far in the series.,5
B000FA64QO,"The events of ""Ylesia"" take place during ""Destiny's Way.""  If you've read ""Destiny's Way,"" you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there, it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.""Ylesia"" doesn't advance ""Destiny's Way"" or ""The New Jedi Order"" in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it, I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF, ""Ylesia"" is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google, you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there.",3
B000FBFMVG,"Really shouldn't have Han Solo on the cover as he doesn't come into the story.This story is all about Chewbacca and his family.I won't give anything away, but it is a nice, if short, read.",5
B000FBFMVG,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.",3
B000FBFMVG,This book was a good idea. I have always wanted to read more about Chewbaccas son Lumpy. Though I do wish he would have added more to the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Star Wars and Chewbacca.,4
B000FBFMVG,"Great short story. It gives a little more insight into the walking carpet we all love, this time as a father",5
B000FBFMVG,I love anything with Chewbacca in it.  Him and his family is just a bonus.  Kind of nice to see him having problems with his son.,5
B000FBFMVG,"A great little chapter to read on my Kindle, but not necessarily worth the price. It would have been a nice addition to The Courtship of Princess Leia or an add on to Tatooine Ghost. I liked it, but when it doesn't even rate being published as a paperback; an avid Star Wars fan you will need to be to download and read this eBook.",5
B000FBFMVG,I love the stories with Chewie in them! this e-book is no exception. great character introductions and wonderful story line.,5
B000FBFMVG,I'm not really sure where it actually fits into the overall story line.This story involves only Chewie and his wife and son.  The other characters are only mentioned in passing.  It was enjoyable and well written but I was glad it was very short and didn't keep me from the main story for very long.,4
B000FBFMVG,"I really do enjoy Troy Denning's work, I want everyone who reads this review to know this.  I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.  I did like seeing that even in a galaxy far far away that we have sons who want to be like their fathers and get into trouble when they do rebellious things.  This story reminded me of what a good writer Troy Denning is and it reminded me to add his other works to my wishlist.Check this one out!",3
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a really good book.  Well written and easy to read.  It made me laugh and made me cry.  Well worth reading this series.  Now on the book two.  Happy reading,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I started the book the night before last but it was so so good that I had finished it last night. It was like watching an action movie for sure. The end is nothing like the typical ending ---- at all!! I am starting the next book asap!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The story was really VERY good but EXTREAMLY annoying. This book should of been read1st in my opinion or 2nd by the authors opinion, if you go by the date the book was written it should be read 3rd. But you don't know you should read it 1st or 2nd until u start reading it. It says it's a prequel to the Mating, again u don't know this till u start reading it! The beginning of the book has a Historical Note, which I think should be read with the first book. As for the story itself, it was very good except there were to many instances where either of the main characters were going to tell the other something important but they were always get cut off. Also, what is it with authors that have to chastise a character who wants to kill an evil person that wants to kill or torture them or a loved one. Early in books, typically the guy says that he will seriously hurt or kill a person if they hurt their loved one but then later in the book they don't DO ANYTHING unless provoked or the author explains in detail why they have a right to hurt or kill someone, like trying to justify it to us. Just kill them already!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a very good book. Over 7000 locations yet i was never bored. I wish there had been more romance and the idea that werewolfs could stay away from their mates for years didnt  sit well with me. But it was a great story i relized who the villian was but it was not obvious.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book answered many questions, gave good background, and its place in the series is perfect, if this book was first I do not think it was have been as interesting.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Excellent series - I loved it starting with the prequel and right into the sequel.  Well done, Nicky Charles.  Thank you!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Brandi is just days away from graduating from the Lycan equivalent of college when she finds herself volunteered for a demonstration of basic self defense ... even though she only received a mercy pass in her own self defense class because the instructor felt she had tried her best at least. The icing on the cake of this experience is that she has been crushing on Reno, the instructor, since she first noticed him on campus and is mortified of looking like a fool. Brandi's roommate had offered her up as a sacrifice for this position because she thought it was a perfect opportunity for Brandi to meet Reno. She had no idea just how right she was.Reno is an Enforcer, it is his job to enforce the Lycan Law. Brandi becomes a Disaster Control Officer, it is her job to clean up after the Enforcers to make sure that humans remain unaware of their Lycan neighbors. While their jobs ensure that Reno's and Brandi's lives intersect often, there is a natural animosity between the two careers. Over the years there is an electrical connection between the two, the tension could be cut with a knife. Each have their own reasons for not wanting to get into a relationship with the other and try to ignore the sparks that fly whenever they are thrown together.This was a LOT better than I had expected and I really cannot think of why I had such low expectations for it. I had downloaded The Mating, which is the first book of this series, well over a year ago from goodreads and never got around to reading it. I saw that this prequel was available for free while selecting my monthly picks, I quickly snatched it up as well as the rest of the books in this series which was free. I was so enthralled with the plot that I don't really recall any editing errors if there were any. A wonderfully twisty story that I really recommend!While this and all the books within the Law of the Lycans series was available as free ebooks on Amazon, which don't usually stay free for long, you may want to see if they are indeed still free. There was a statement at the end of the book that the books will remain free and if you like them to donate the approximate cost of the book to your nearest animal or homeless shelter and help make a life better. It is great to see writers who are obviously writing for the sheer pleasure of it and not just hoping to turn a quick buck.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is a prequel book that gives this series a back story and start.  I enjoyed this book and the whole series.  I read this first, then went to The Mating, The Keeping, The Finding, then lastly Betrayed.  I think this is the best way to read this series as this book (Bonded) travels over many years that ends up covering the time frame that puts the end of it and close to the end of Betrayed at the same spot.  None of the books need the others to be a full book, but since the story and characters are very good, and make you want more, read them all.. or, do what I did, inhale them.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I can't brag enough about Nicky Charles,  How many good authors do you knbow that give their books away, Yeha for Nicky.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I recently discovered this author and enjoy reading her books. This book was such a good story, so complete in the telling. All of the characters were three dimensional, which made them very real.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It kept me interested throughout the entire book. What more can you ask for!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was so good that I read it in 2 days.  I could not put it down and have never really been a fan of the werewolf stories.  Give it a try and you will be surprised.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Have read other Nicky Charles books and liked them, this NO  ! too mushy and dumb,not up to his standers",2
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a great book.  I really enjoyed the characters of Brandy and Reno. This is my first time I read any books about Lycans and I really enjoyed it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I liked the personalities of the main characters and, to a certain extent, the plot had some twists that kept me reading.  However, it is much, much too predictable, especially in the romance department.  How long can you drag out ""poor me, I'm don't deserve to be loved""?And her martyrdom, when she goes for years without telling him about her ""problem"" - pretty stupid, and not understandable based on the characters as developed in the story...The action has some suspense and is fairly interesting, again with a couple of too predictable developments that pulled me out of the experience.Some people seem to dig the sex scenes -- to me they are sort of silly.  There seems to be a formula where a certain amount of explicit sex needs to be included somewhere in these novels.  Do people really think sex is where ""soul mates"" are forged???? Or is it just the woman's version of Playboy?",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I enjoyed this story. At times I got frustrated with Brandi`s dilemma. However the last few chapters made up for it!,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I'm doing student teaching for early childhood education and I started this book two weeks before the end of the semester! I would work out when to do homework and read! Awesome book!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Love all her books all of them are great. Loved the story it's got great build up and suspense in each one.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I was hesitant to read this book at first, thinking it was another twilight knock off. But I was pleasantly surprised that it was the complete opposite! Since the very first page, I found myself trying to speed read and skip ahead just too see what would happen next. The suspense was almost too much. Great story line with a strong foundation. I can't wait to continue the series! Kudos to the author.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I'm not big on writing reviews, there is a reason I'm a reader not a writer!  ;-)  A very good read, but a bit long for me.  If you are into a great long reads, this one is for you and you can't beat ""free"" with a stick.  I liked this one so much that now have ALL the books in this series.  You will fall in love with both Reno & Brandi!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Awesome.....Love the characters....have read all but one of the series.. starting it today....plan to watch for more book Nicky Charles. Great author.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Bonded is a book where we are taken and introduced to the Lycan world. The radical group, The Purists, are looking to weed out the weak blooded half were. Lycan Link is the agency within the Lycan world trained to weed out these radical groups.I feel there is a lot of base story in this book, but it holds its own. I don't like giving away any of the plot when I write my reviews but I will tell you that if you enjoy Alpha weres and their strong mates, then you will enjoy this.Read again: maybeRecommend: yesHeat:3.5/5",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Brandi was a tough one. To be able to work with such a extremely sexy man and to be patrial blood bonded and keep it secret... Enough said.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Definitely love that this heroine is very career minded and independent. Loved their constant bickering/banter. You could definitely feel the spark. Has a great plot. The author did a great job at giving the reader their back story. Still surprised it was free!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Enjoyed this book from start to finish. The characters were all well explained, organized, and easy to follow. There is humor, mystery, and it is easy to identify with Brandi and her feelings. Once you get started with this series, you won't want to stop. The entire series is entertaining!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Good book. It was slow in places but had enough action to keep me interested. Cried at the end.... love Damien.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Great story! Wonderful character development and lots of nice steamy tidbits. I very much enjoyed this read and am looking forward to the next book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Have been enjoying all of these stories written by Nicky Charles.  Interesting enough to look for other stories written by the same person.  Great story line and keeps me coming back for more.  I will also visit the local SPCA as per the writers wishes.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I am new to the werewolf stories and never thought I would want to read them.  Nicky Charles changed that for me and I'm looking forward to future writings.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I can't believe that you give away your stories. Thank you for the entertainment I have enjoyed your series a lot.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed the series and I'd recommend it to others for sure. I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the prequel was than the other books. Unfortunately, the first book in the series didn't float my boat, if you will, as it was very long and the relationship between the main characters was just too tortured. I think this book could really be read by many different audiences so that gives it a great deal of kudos from me.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I enjoyed this book very much and downloaded the whole series. It's a free download and so are the other books in the series so you won't get left hanging at the end waiting for the next book. I enjoyed all the plot twists and it was definitely well written. Kept me on the edge of my seat.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I found this series a few months ago and wanted to start at the beginning- even though I was more interested in the Mating. I should have gone with my first mind. Brandi and Remi or Royce or whoever (I just finished the book and I can't remember his name)... had NO chemistry. He doesn't even seem to like her until the end when he claims to love her. She spends most of the book thinking about him/talking about him like he is a member of boy band. This book is mind numbing, slow paced (how that can be when it skips ahead years at a time I don't know) and a real waste of time. It got a second star because at least I got a whole story instead of 40 pages of crappy sex scenes for $3.99.",2
B00BT0J8ZS,I had never read anything from this author before. Was pleasantly surprised. Good story. Hot sex scenes. Lovable characters. Will read the rest in this series..,3
B00BT0J8ZS,I loved this book! I read it as quickly as I could! Simply amazing. Plus at the end the author suggests that you donate to a local animal shelter instead of paying for the book! :) made me love the book that much more!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I love Nicky Charles work, she a great Author,her book series were excellent and entwined very well together from book to book, you never lost track of who the players were and where the story line was going..EXCELLENT!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I read the entire series. It had a good plot line and good characters that made you want to continue till you read them all.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I usually don't read about werewolves but after seeing one in the True blood series (Alcide is hot!) I decided to look for a book with werewolves in it. This series did not disappoint!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Let me start by saying the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the word 'practice' was spelled 'practise'. I read The Mating first an in that one the word 'realize' was spelled 'realise' all but 5 times... And it was extremely frequent. In this book it was spelled correctly thank goodness as the author likes to use it a lot.Having said that, it was incredible story that had you feeling for the characters. You want things to work for Brandi and Reno. Brandi is a no nonsense woman who is independent and strong willed, perhaps too much for her own good. Reno is equally pigheaded, too down on himself to realize what a good man he is. They are both fighting a fate that they actually want. Definite page turner. I couldn't put it down.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Rating: 4.5 starsI have really loved the Lycan series by Nicky and I can't wait to read the next one. You get pulled into the world that is created and can't help but fall in love with the characters. If you like hot shifter books than you definitely need to pick up this series. :),4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Reno, you've seem to have it all. I enjoyed his journey to save others, dominate with a mate & form new adventures in his job",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"Same story as all the others in this series.  The writing is so much the same, that I keep thinking that I have already read the book.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"The book was the first that I read of the author, and I became hooked and quickly went onto read the entire series and still want more.  This story is really good, it seems to drag on at times, but the characters are enjoyable and the story keeps your interest peeked!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,The short summary of the book.pretty much tells it all. Some back and forth between the main characters with a little suspense added in. I found myself rooting for their relationship and wondering if they would ever get together.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book gives a modern day history of Lyncan Links which has a university, and different departments that maintain damage control if a werewolf has been sighted, another department protects half caste Lyncans from the purists.  Bonded also makes reference to Lyncans in future books.  Highly recommended",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book has everything a book in this genre should have, I laughed, I cried, I even got frustrated at times and even became sad a few times.  I would strongly recommend if you love books in this genre.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is a great book. It is very detailed and the story keeps you interested til the end. I would buy this book but its actually free which is even better. Very good read.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is a great book. It was kind of hard for me to get into, but once it gets going it's really good. I am getting ready to download the next one, and hope that it's as good. The only criticism I have is that it's a bit long winded. I wish that it progressed faster, but at the same time it hooks you so...I definitely recommend giving it a chance.It really pisses me off that Damien loses it and goes rouge, but wth would you expect after all. Reno and Brandi will steal your heart, Damien will break it, and everyone else gets to mend it all.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This is a great series. I should've read this book first. The author makes every book a page turner. There's one more book in the series & I'm sure it'll be just as good as the rest.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This series has yet to disappoint me. If your looking for an easy read that keeps your attention then this is a great series to read.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"this was a fun and amazing series to read, i enjoyed it every step of the way... its a must read!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very well written. The characters jump to life page by page.I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,What a great book.  I wished I would have realized in what order to read this as I didnt know there was a series.  I have recently loaded all and am on the 3rd in two days.  A great find in the bookworld!,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"What can I say about Nikky Charles' work besides DO NOT MISS OUT ON IT!!! Bonded is another fantastic installment/or can be a stand alone book that will turn into a book that you just keep going back to, it will own a little piece of home in your heart.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I am truly glad for your writing skills read the entire series out of order finding it by accident they stand alone and together. Gradually they order me to finish reading them awesome awesome books,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Loved this series. I normally don't write reviews but in lieu of payment, that is what this author requested and I feel it is well worth my time to say how much I have enjoyed her series and fell in love with each of the characters. Definitely a page turner and kept me wrapped in from beginning to end and immediately beginning the next one in the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"First read of Nicky Charles books and I read the rest quickly.  Couldn't wait to turn the pages.  A little too graphic sexually for my comfort, but the story is mesmerizing.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Like other reviewers already said this has waaayyyy too much fluff and with the many good reviews I expected much more. The sex scenes are just ok, and the sexual tension goes from good to lukewarm, just not worth it. I liked the H (Reno)character and also Damien but didn't care much for the h (Brandi). I like a good alpha male and I normally like shifter stories but this one was mostly boring. At around 35% I lost my patience and started to skip and scan through to just catch more of the relevant stuff. I finished the book to see how it ended (ok). It was free so no great loss but this author will go on my 'do not read' list.",2
B00BT0J8ZS,Elise and Kane's beginning was unlike most marriages because neither had a choice in the mating but they eventually fell in love and the mating of convenience became true love.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I like this book and couldn't wait to find out what would happen in The Mating (book 1). I then got all three books that were in this series. It was a good read and free!,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I truly enjoyed this first book in the series from nicky charles! Not only am I totally interested in what happens to the characters but where the story is set has lots of potential. I normally go for regency style romances so werewolves and modern day adventure was a stretch, a delightful stretch. I can't wait to get into the next book in the series!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I've loved all the ebooks I've read by Nicky Charles!  I like the take on werewolves where they were not all 'gruesome' when they turned into werewolves.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,So love it. I have grown so used to the characters in the Lyman series wish to know what happens to all of them.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoy when an author offers a book for free. It gives me a chance to sample their work. I'm disgusted by people who go around writing one-star reviews on books they download for free. They got the work FREE! It's a GIFT! Why bash it just because they can? Just mind-boggling. Just goes to show you the state of the world and the sense of entitlement some people have. And some people are just plain negative and bitter, no matter which way you slice it. When I download a free book, I'm appreciative that I got a FREE GIFT. In this case, the free gift was an excellent book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The story flowed, the characters were interesting, and there were no plot holes or grammar errors like in some books. Five stars and two thumbs up! I'll be buying the next book and the rest of this author's series. Keep up the good work!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I love my werewolf stories. This is a prequel to The Mating. I read these out of order so I will go back and happily re-read The Mating.Reno is an Enforcer for Lycan Link. He believes he is all but a rogue wolf waiting to happen if he lets his gaurs down. Brandy is a young she wolf looking for a career & a way out of her little backwoods town. The two meet!Reno is stubborn & Brandy is worse! Good thing I love the wolves! This is a wonderful story if a bit long with the two of them not getting it together for over 3 yrs! The epilogue will blow you away.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Liked the book because it's the start of the series and doesn't disappoint with the story line. Would recommend to others.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"There were twists and turns in this story that I didn't see coming, and the relationships are amazing. I wish I would have read these books in story order not release order.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Ok so I know this series is FREE (which is awesome) but I have to say that I would pay so much more for this novel. I love werewolves as much as the next girl but this one takes the cake. I can't say more without dropping a bomb on you unsuspecting review readers so I will just say that there are many major twists in this novel. When reading believe no one, trust only the main character, and be one with your wolf!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed it. I'm not usually a shape shifter or werewolf fan but this was enjoyable in a sify way. Unusual but very enjoyable.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have read all of this series by Nicky Charles, and I highly recommend them to all who love the paranormal. I couldn't stop reading them, they were so enjoyable. As soon as I finished one I went online and got the next one. Happy reading to e everyone who tries this series, and thanks to Nicky for another series well done!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Has all the things I look for in a book - humor, drama, action, suspense, and good story line. If you like fantasy stories about lycan lives, you will like this series. Well written.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,I did not think I would enjoy this category of fiction but find I want to read more. It is written well and the story lines are believable for this particular genre.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Loved the book, I have downloaded all the others in this series now. I am starting Damien's story next really not sure if I am going in order, but they are too good to stop. Also love that they are all free downloads, I liked them so much that I will definitely be donating to a animal charity. I think this was a wonderful idea on the Author's part. So if you love a good paranormal romance and lots of action, these are the books to read.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"A fantastic read! The characters were believable in every aspect. The plot kept getting thicker with each turn of the page. Never really wanted to put it down. In fact there were a few times I had to force myself to do just that. As far as the "" spelling "" wasn't even an issue. Can't wait to dive into the next book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I downloaded this book, as well as all the others in the series one night, on a whim. I got bored with a current read and switched to this one, again, on a whim, since I have sooo many other books to be read in front of this one. I could NOT put this book down. I'd fall asleep reading it. This was amazing. The fact that it was free completely baffled me, it's sooo well written. The story line is great, the tension between the characters is phenomenal. The heartbreak that she makes you feel is so wrenching, you feel like its happening to you. I wanted to cry. At the end of the book my heart broke so much for another character. I don't want to spoil it, but this book was beyond anything that I expected. Definitely must read. At the end of the book, the author tells you that if you want to contribute to anything, since books are free, to donate to an animal shelter. How truly awesome is that? Anywho, READ THIS BOOK, NOW! &lt;3 Reviewed by Ashley E. of Fae Books.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was absolutely great book. The story kept me interested and I couldn't put it down. Got to get the next book by Nicky Charles. Great author.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Wow! This book was so enjoyable to experience. It fulfilled all of my expectations. There is suspense, drama, romance and sizzling emotions between the two main characters. I'm really looking forward to reading the next book in the series!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is not a bad read although it is slow and the characters equally slow or at least slow-witted.  It seems to take forever to get together because they clash over stupid things mostly that could be solved half way through the book.  A little tightening could really put this into the great book category but still it was free and Reno finally got his head in the right place, and I like that the author talks of donations to good causes as opposed to being paid.  Not everyone can do this but more importantly not everyone would think of it so it gives Nicky Charles that little extra.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I had read The Finding and was motivated to read more in the series.  Totally enjoyed th premise and story line.  Recommend for those who enjoy romance stories and have a love of animals.  I shall continue to read more of the series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I really liked this book. It kept me on edged. I really like this Author Nicky Charles amazing........... I would definitely recommend this book!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"With all the books I've read so far by Nicky Charles and the Law of the Lycans set I was just there with them. They all pulled me in and I couldn't put them down. Just getting to know each person and hear their stories and see their lives and how they continue on with the other parts of the family and then the end with Cassie and her story, I was blown away. I can't say enought about The Mating, The Keeping, The Finding, The Bonding and I can't wait to read Betrayed: Days of the Rogue. I'm pretty sure I know who it's going to be about and I'm dying to know what he's been up to. Love them all and can't say enough good about them and how they flow with eachother!!! It's nice to find another paranormal series that's not about vampires that just pulls me in and keeps me wanting more.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Never expected that I would enjoy a book such as this. Great story line and can't wait to start the second in this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This story was well written & interesting to read. It is nice to read a novel in this genre instead of a short story or novella which seems more of the norm than not.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I Love her books. this series was excellent , I wish I had more. I love them. I want more.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I like all her books. I haven't found one that I don't like. And they r all free she just enjoys writing. Which I thought was really neat.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Awesome book - just when I think about the other books by Nicky Charles has written , they keep getting better... I am looking forward to the next... A must read and a promise the suspense will not allow you to put them down..",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Great story and I love that it wasn't really short! Going to read the next book now, tell you if I liked it tomorrow when I'm done-",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is just another example of how good writing should be. Nicky has you on edge all the time, you can't seem to wait to turn the page and see what happens. The book was thrilling, exciting and had a lot of romance, sex, suspense. I highly recommend to read this one before the mating, i read it after i finished with the finding, but still it could be considered as a standalone even though it mentions some of the characters we already know.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Another good book from Nicky Charles. These characters pull you in. The story lines never fail either. read the entire series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I love this whole series and this is one of the better of the set that has a crazy twist to it!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I read the mating before I read this and both books are incredible. I got so attached to the characters and I'm so sad about Beth and Damien. I have already downloaded the finding and the keeping. Nicky Charles is an amazing writer.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I so far have read four of your books, I am I live with every character. I can't get enough.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Thanks Nicky, can't wait to start the next!!One of the best series I've read in awhile!!! Highly recommend and a must read for Lucian lovers!!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was my first wolf book instead of a vampire book. Still has the love connection but take years to happen. The ending was totally unexpected.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,A great story. It kept my interest all the time. True romance and suspense. Can not wait to read the next in the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,ENJOYED VERY MUCH!!  Love the suspense and happy with the ending. Great to see true love out.  Can't to start on the next book!,3
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is a romantic were wolf story set entirely in the Lycan world.  Imagine a complete society that exists within the normal [average] world which tries to keep itself hidden from the hysteria and prejudices of the outsiders.  Within this world are public spin masters, a governmental system, local packs and enforcers.  These people, weres, want only to live their lives amongst their kind and to live it peacefully.  The plot line is about two love birds that fight the urge to give into love for a three years period.  Dispite working together and seeing each other constantly, they refuse to explore the possibilities.  With separatists or purists battles frequently bringing them together and others noting their closeness you know what has to occur.  Enjoy the read.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Stupendous, wonderful and heart wrenching story.  This is my first Nicky Charles book, and I'm so anxious to read more. Tension, plot, character development, ... you name it ... for me almost perfect.Only one critique, that has nothing to do with the story of the writing itself ... in my Kindle edition there were four spots where the book formatting skips a few pages!!  I hope there's an update to this book correcting this, because I already know this is one I'll read at least once more!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I downloaded this book because I love series type reads. This was amazing! I can't wait to read The Mating next!! Very well written!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is an excellent read. The story is an excellent example of how the heart and brain don't have the same wants and needs. Keeps you guessing the whole time wondering what is next. free download,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I'm so in love with Reno Smith and Damien! I hope to see more of these characters in the future! Wonderful book!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I have enjoy this author. The books are intertwined and great stories. I have recommend them to friends. I plan to follow the works of this author.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Nicky Charles is a wonderful author.  All of her paranormal series involving the werewolf packs are enjoyable reading.  Her characterizations of various humans and werewolves are enjoyable.I would suggest that you read the books in the order she prescribes.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Enjoyed reading the book. Have the rest of this series. Cannot wait to get into the next book. Hope it is as good as this was. The characters are good. The plot is good. Not the same as others out there.thanks,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book sets the tone for the series - you get the gist of the stories and how the characters will play out in the story.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is a very great read! Very fast paced and it grabs your attention, you will not want to put it down.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed this book. Brandi & Reno just couldn't make it work.. Trying to stay away from each other but with a job that kept bringing them together, they fight what they feel for each other. Brandi fights it and then decides to change jobs. Taking a vacation to her home town & finding herself needing Reno's help tests them both...will they get together in the end...read on to see if these Lycan can figure it out.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved this book and the characters(most of them). Just about couldn't put it down.  I love what Reno and Brandi and the a.c.s team are fighting for.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I can't believe that you can get a book this good for free.  There was a lot of action, which I like the most.  Very easy to read and very enjoyable.  Thanks Nicky and I will donate.  Love animals also.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have to be honest, werewolves/shifters are not my favorite book characters. I don't know why. I've just felt that, eventually, they all become the same story. Not this series! I loved all five books and am looking forward to more! I thought it was a fresh take on the whole shifters world and really enjoyed it! I went through all five books in a matter of days, and they're all full-length, not novellas.I read 'The Mating' first, not realizing that 'Bonded' was the prequel. It didn't spoil the series for me in any way as I feel any of the books can be read alone, as well, but it was a terrific lead-in to the rest of the series. It was exciting and original, and it actually kept me guessing as to what was going to happen. There was one part that just shocked me and broke my heart, but the ending was very satisfying.I recommend this whole series as not only a terrific read but they're all being offered for FREE here on Amazon at the time of this review. How much more can you ask for? If you don't have a Kindle eReader, you can download the free Kindle App and read on your computer or phone.Prequel: Bonded (Law of the Lycans #0.5)The Mating (Law of the Lycans #1)The Keeping (Law of the Lycans #2)Betrayed: Days of the Rogue (Law of the Lycans, #2.5)The Finding (Law of the Lycans, #3)",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The book is one among a series of free books in series about Lycans.  It is the third I have read and am in the process of reading the fourth.  Really enjoyed the story line.  The only part I see to edit is the repetitive parts that have already been explained previously, or have happened in the same book.  This is the life story of an &#34;Enforcer&#34; of Lycan Law, and a female whose jobs tend to conflict. The villain was not easily identified.  Really like the interplay of the Wolf/vs/human sides of the characters.  I was saddened by the ending--but want to read on to find out how the character proceeds.  Another thing I like in the series is a peek at the lives of characters met in previous stories.  Thank you Ms. Charles for hours of entertainment.  I have downloaded the 4 free and purchased the last for the very low price of 2.99.  Would have paid more.  I recommend the entire series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I loved this book. I would of given it 5 stars if there wasn't such back and forth between the main charachters. It is 999 pages that didn't seem like 999. I enjoyed the character and plot developement. I read this book prior to The Mating and I am glad that I read it in that order. I am now on the second novel and I think that reading Bonded has added to my understanding of the series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,The author has a great story line that keeps the reader interested.  There is some mature content.  I can't believe the author doesn't write full time.  She definitely has a talent and I can't wait to read the next book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I happened on to this book when I was looking for a new series to start. I was not disappointed! I loved the way Nicky Charles created the characters and their believable interactions. I couldn't believe it was free, that made it even better. I downloaded the entire series. Can't wait fir the next book! Be sure to read these in order as the characters are reoccurring in the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very curious to find out what happens to Damien. I was a little more distracted with all the details. Lost my interest a little but still a good read.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Great characters, captivating story line, turns and twists in the story, interesting relationships all combined to make a totally fantastic novel you will not want to put down until u read the words fin",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The last of the series,  Leaves a lot of loose ends and I am still wondering what happened to some of the people",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I was bonded to the book. Loved the story .Loved the suspense.  Love the idea of donating to the animal shelter !!  My pups were rescued and they thank you and any one reading this that decides to donate. Now  MY  inner wolf is urging me on to the next book The Mating.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Lot of fun to read. Takes you away. I am a supporter of the ASPCA. Thanks a lot for all.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book is a stand alone story as well as the first in this author's Lycan series. I enjoyed that the werewolves in this book were people who had jobs, went to work, college, fell in love, and also happened to be wolves sometimes. They weren't all superheroes or power hungry villains or even movie monsters, they were people with certain genes who were born into a society that had to blend in and keep  certain parts of itself hidden.In order to survive, hundreds of years ago, the Ancient Lycan elders had written down some laws and codes to keep the werewolf society secret from and separate from humans. As time went on, and the Lycans learned to adapt and they were no longer threatened with extinction, some of the ancient code became less and less relevant, especially as it pertained to dating and mating with humans. It was forbidden by ancient law for there to be half human/half werewolf offspring because it detracted from the ""purity""  of the line. In modern times, most packs had done away with this, since ""halves"" were common and usually could shift just fine; the packs also accepted their human parent as part of the pack as well. There was a small group of ""purists"" who were moving in on isolated packs and taking over, spewing anti-human rhetoric and killing or enslaving any humans in that pack and then forcing their children to work as slaves.This is where our protagonists come in. Reno Smith is an Enforcer with the Lycan Line, the bureaucracy that oversees Lycan affairs for North America.  When there's trouble in a pack, like the purists' holding families hostage, it's Reno and his team's job to go in and fix it.Brandi Johansson also works for Lycan Line, but she works in Damage Control. She has to come up with cover stories for why three families ""moved"" away from the area overnight, or what was that wolf doing out of the zoo?  if a nervous werewolf shifted in front of someone. She spends a lot of time smoothing things over after Reno gets done with his job, because he's not very diplomatic. Strangely, she doesn't mind. She's had a crush on him since college. Actually, it's a little more than a crush,but it was an accident, really! One day, Brandi's friend volunteered her to be a demonstration assistant in the self defense class Reno was teaching, They wrestled around, got a lot turned on, she accidentally scratched him, and some blood was exchanged.  Who knew you could blood bond with someone by accident? Not Brandi! Basically, Reno has ruined her for other wolves AND she can feel what he's feeling if she doesn't block really, really hard. Reno, on the other hand, is not blood bonded and is sure he's the type to lose his mind and go rogue one day, so he won't consider a serious relationship, although if it would be anyone it would be Brandi.Ups and downs over the years leave Brandi miserable, until she finally packs to move, taking a short vacation first. When Brandi finds herself in trouble, who can she call? And will he come to save her? The purists are conspiring to make sure no word gets out, but if it does, it'll look like Brandi has been helping them all along.The writing was excellent, the characters well written and interesting and the plot complex. I loved the push/pull between Reno and Brandi, they seemed like such opposites but they fit together so well. The epilogue of this book sets up another purist act of terrorism against Reno's partner, Damien and his pregnant half wife, Beth,killing her and their baby and sending Damien rogue.Nicky Charles does not charge for her books, but instead asks that the reader donate the cost of a book to a local animal rescue group. I will be sure to do this as a thank you to the author for giving such a great series for free.Heat factor moderate.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,These books are fun and exciting and best if you read these in order.I started the first book and didnt stop until i read everyone...yes this is a great book!!!,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"What a brilliant book. Having been raised on Lassie, White Fang and 101Almations, you can only immagine my delight at discovering my human had downloaded thiis work. I just hope he has the good sence to download the rest of the series otherwise I might be forced to conduct a little protest, you know the sort of thing, the odd do-do in the flat or yacking in the car. Look out for my reviews. P.S. It's actally the 'Weres' that are the halves, I know what I'm barking about! Your appreciative, loyal and devoted friend, Maco (Springer Spaniel).",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am so happy I found this series, this really does a great job of setting the stage and pulling the reader in.  Great Job...",5

B00BT0J8ZS,This book was also as good as the others in the series. It keeps you wanting more.  You will enjoy reading this.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,What a wonderful find this book series was! I loved every thing about this book. I devoured it in two days.This book is the first in the Lycan series and is a prequel to the Mating.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Good stories and easy reading with lots of twists.  I enjoyed the series even though I read them out of sequence but that is the beauty of the stories. You can read each book as it's own entity but they are all intertwined to make a great series, whether you read them in order or not. I highly recommend these books!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I love all of Nicky Charles books.  I like her characters, I like how she develops them and the story is very interesting. I'm waiting for her next book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Love at first fight, or at the very least, lust. I just couldn't hardly put the book down. Reno is gorgeous, and he's not the only one! You fall in love with Damien, and just know he's going to have a terrible Tragic happening in his life. Must read!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,It taking me to long to read this novel only because some of the chapters could've been eliminated. but considering that the novel is already written well..... I had fun reading the book anyway.,2
B00BT0J8ZS,I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a quick read and the series makes you love the characters!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Thoroughly enjoyed the entire story. Felt the characters were full and real. Parts even made me feel tearie eyed. Can't wait to read more.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Great read can not wait to read the next installment.  If we are all tolerant of each other we might survive on plant Earth.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is the second and best of the two so far in ways!  It caught my curiosity much quicker. From the first page. Just as I just made a mistake, there's a few typing errors in it but, much better than last, as expected.  This author is truly growing on my interest in book types! I'm not usually into werewolves but, I can't help but read on again! I also love his love of animals, asking of a donation locally for them! That's a wonderful thing to just ask so little and deliver such novels! It's very nobel to say the least",5
B00BT0J8ZS,fun love story about werewolves- second book of the trilogy- great story of family traditions and ways of life in a different culture,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am becoming a fan of sci-fi, paranormal and fantasy books - never read this type of book before and now find myself being drawn to the stories - all the Lycan books from Nicky Charles are a great read with some suprisingly good &#34;erotic&#34; parts in the storyline - essentially they are love stories and stories about family honor, etc.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Like riding a role coaster. Thrilling through out. Cannot wait to read more. Every books keeps you wanting more. You become enthralled with the characters.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was great. I fell in love with the characters and can't wait to start the next one. I was sorry to see the story end. A must read!!!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Thoroughly enjoyed this book and are looking forward to reading the rest of the set. Recommend this to anyone that likes enjoys this sort of stories. Loved it,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The author asks for a donation to a local animal shelter in lieu of payment for the book.  The whole series is excellent and compelling.  Well written and edited.  Fin, keep up the excellent writing!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed reading this book. The storyline did not get boring. The storyline was as plausible as it could be considering the topic. Excellent read,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I love that all these books are free and therefore I'm reluctant to post a bad review, not that this is a bad review as such. I loved the characters especially Reno and Damien and enjoyed getting early glimpses of Kane and Ryne, the story was interesting it was just in my opinion too long and the relationship between Brandi and Reno was way too repetitive and dragged out, I was skipping over large sections to avoid reading the same thing again to the point where I'd got past caring if they ever got together. It's a shame because this could have been a really really good book.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed reading this book.  There was enough suspense in this book that it was hard to put it down.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,OMG this book was solo good. I don't  want to give anything away if you read the last 3 then you will love this one. Well I'm off to the next book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"A society of werewolves...how interesting! Moved along well, lots of supense. Love entangelments, murder & heartbreak.Kept my interest all the way through.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"When I found these book, I thought wow all free, I wondered was it a new author. In all fairness I thought maybe they were not good, hence free. I Was Very WRONG. This author is amazing, the story grips you and never puts you down. I am happily off to read the next. All this author asks is donate in lieu of payment. So I shall,to the local food bank. Off to the next, thank you Nicky, your talent is greatly appreciated.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I loved reading this book. A great thriller/suspense. The characters are awesome. I liked every thing about them. The story is well written. I had a hard time putting it down. I am looking forward to reading more in this series. Definitely recommended.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I really enjoyed this book, I,ll spend all week getting the rest in the series's . It pulled me in with in the first chapter and I couldn't put it down till I was done.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Did not read.... Not fair to rate low in that event, but I just had had enough of this series.",2
B00BT0J8ZS,"Love all of NIcky's books, I love the way everything is connected to each other! Recommended reading other books too!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is good so far. I have the series for this and found out after there's a prior series and then more series after. Wish they where labeled as series 1 book 1 and so forth. Otherwise as a story it stands good alone too.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a good book but I am not sure how it can be called a prequel to Mating since it contains no character from the Lycan series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Very entertaining, this one is on the subject of bigotry,  and of course.. Love  Lots of drama, and hot scenes.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed reading the story from both of the main characters perspective, as well as the time lapses. They didn't just &#34;fall in love&#34; in a few days, it happened over years.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Yes this is a wonderful series just finished the preqeul to mating . Loving the charaters and the story line. Also very impressed with the request at the end for readers to donate to local rescues in lu of paying for the book. I run a small cat rescue and love the fact the author put them before his self. Getting ready to read the next book in the series, if you haven't started this is a good one to start with.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I do not normally read books of this nature but a friend recommended. I really enjoyed the author and how the story moved. I will read more by this author. Really pleased someone opened my eyes to the author....,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I really enjoyed reading this 1st book in this series. WOW, it kept your attention from start to finish. The author did a great job telling the story and the characters just brought the story to life! Read this book, because it will make you laugh, cry and cum a bit! The story has lots of twists and turns. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I never read any of Nicky Charles books before and this was just awesome. It was so intense, action packed, and sexy. I just couldn't wait to finish the book. Now for the next one.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"THIS WAS AN OFF THE SEAT STORY, I CAN'T TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I GOT UP TO  THRILLED TO  SIT AND READ THE NEXT PAGE. I HOPE IF YOU LOVE ROMANCE STORIES THIS IS A GREAT ONE.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Definitely surprised..this my first time reading Nicky Charles...she recommended to me, and I'm soooo glad I got her books...welllll, I actually got all of them and can't wait to read the others! Loved !! Make sure ou pick this one up and her others!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is the second of Nicky Charles' books I have read. I was surprised that she had written more books having read The Mating first about a year ago. I read a wide range of books and with Kindle it makes it easy. I have down loaded all the Nicky Charles' books in this series. We have 2 star crossed lovers wondering if they really love each other. Bonded explains the links between mates. I guess the author was trying to build suspense by keeping the lovers at odds with each and the will he/she ever come to their senses. The author left you wanting more and left it open for more books. If your into were romance than the series is for you. If you just like reading about Weres then go ahead and read it.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have always liked books about werewolves, vampires and such.  This book is well written.  The character's are so real, it's kind of scarlet.  I love the plot along with the romantic twist.  Reno is tough and macho, but yet not.  Brandi is delight to figure out.  And the two together are dynamite.  The challenge is given, matched, and ended in a spectacular way.  Can't wait to read the next book in series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I wish I would have read this book sooner. What was I thinking waiting so darn long. I just loved Reno he was swoon worthy.. Cant wait to see where this series goes. Great writing and a great PNR.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,These story's are just TOOOOawesome for words..... I have read them out of order but still....  Love them and can put them all together .. But if your just starting out read them in order.  It's just a wonderful series. Thank you Nicky for this great story please keep them coming.  Beth.N.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"What a story of courage, mystery.  Was surprised that all the characters we so independent in their actions.  Was impressed. Thanks.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The two characters in this book were extremely obtuce, and behaved like animals but I guess that's what they were!!",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"If you are just starting this series, start with this one. I had already read The Mating because I didn't know about this one,  However, it is fast paced, with action and suspense and a lot of humor. Her characters are sarcastic, witty, and fun to read. The romance is sizzling and if you like paranormal romance, this series is for you.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I loved this series of books! Nicky Charles is one of the best writers in this genre. I read the books in order, but each stands alone as a great read.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Wow!! When reading the free books, I have come to expect shorter stories with less developed story lines. Not with Bonded! This book has fully developed story lines, intriguing characters and details that really immersed me into the story. So excited to start reading the next book in the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Loved everything, it's a great book. If your looking for adventure, excitement, and a great love story, you found it. The characters are believable and the story is so real, you get lost in it. Nicky has done a wonderful job writing this and making you feel a part of it. Looking forward to the others in this series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,The love story is a bit unusual and parallel to it is a good mystery. For a werewolf story the female lead is fairly independent.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was outstanding I couldn't put this book down.  I read ""The Mating""  before this book because I read that book I had to read the whole series.  I will read them all like the way she writes.  I have a fondness about reading paranormal especially shifters.  This author gives you a full history of the werewolf and how they function in the human society or should I say remain hidden.  The story line was complete and characters are fully developed.  I am looking forward in reading the rest of the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I read the ""Mating""  before the ""Bonded"" but even that doesn't make a difference of how well written and storied it is. I'll read the rest of the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This series is really good! I enjoyed the storyline and the way the books intersect. Would love another book in this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I liked the characters and the writers style.Development and attention to detail were great as well as series connection between the books,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I was unable to put this book down. Action, adventure, loyalty and love. Story and characters were well developed and makes you want to read all of them",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I was completely captivated by this book! This book gives so much background into the under workings of the werewolf world. I love that this story takes place over years versus weeks or months! It makes it more real to life rather than all fairy tale romance! I love that even though the hero is crazy about the heroine he tries to stay away because he thinks he is no good for her! This to me was the tied for second best with her &#34;The Finding.&#34;,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was a fun, sexy, entertaining story & I read the entire series.  It didn't take long to read & was something you can put down & pick back up later without forgetting the story.  It was perfect at the time since I was looking for something light & fun and this was perfect.Make sure you look up the order of the books since it will help a lot knowing how the characters fit in and the storyline continues.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is a great werewolf series! Nicky is a great writer. This is probably the best werewolf series I have read thus far!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This story was a great adventure. It had an on again off again love story, with mystery and adventures all mixed up. It had happy and sad endings,and lovable characters.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I've already read 3 books in this series, but unfortunately I wasn't able to find this one first. It didn't matter, I was still caught up in the story and the characters. I really love Nicky Charles' style of writing. At times I caught myself actually smiling while reading. How often does that happen while reading a book? :)It's been quite awhile since I have sat down and read a book front to back in one day. For me, this was a very good read. I look forward to reading the rest of Nicky Charles books.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed reading this book!  I loved the characters and story line. Well worth the time to read. I will be reading the next book in this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really like that the Nicky's werewolves are different than most other writer's wolf characters.She brings their lives and stories into our world in an interesting way.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very good series.  The first book gets you wrapped up with the characers.  Additonal books draw you in.  Best free series of books I have ever read.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is my first kindle book and it was exciting to read.  I am hooked.  I think I will read the series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Omg!!!! This book is so good!!!! If you like alpha werewolves, fullblodded werewolves half human werewolves or either one then you should totally read this book!!!! This book deserves 5 stars!!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"At first I thought this was going to be a Harlequin Romance type ""man gets woman"" story but with werewolves. But I have to admit Nicky Charles is a very good writer and I was drawn into the story completely. Can't wait to read the rest of the series! Try it, you'll love it.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I have not been able to put this series down ... They just keep getting better and better. They can get a lil long winded but you get so caught up in the story that you don't mind it . Read them for yourself and you will see what mean..,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I was looking for something nice, light and fantasy to read. And found a whole series for free (as a vet I promise to give my own part for these books, Nicky)!So back to the point. I read this one first - it's absolutely gorgeous! Strong, full blooded characters. Good pacing, well structured world, good concept of the enemy figures. The main characters were nice, not flawless, nor dumb or dull. The story covered a good period of time without being too fast/ too slow or suffering inexplicable gaps and holes.This was definitely so much better than I expected from a free book. And please, do not take this too personally, but usually free book are way worse. What really warmed my heart was the author's note at the end - how to pay back for a free book = great idea, and a considerate one. Thank you, Nicky Charles, this was delicious experience.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"You can get lost in this series.  The characters are so lifelike.  You empathize with all their thoughts, actions.  Their way of life is enticing.  You may find yourself looking for a pack.  I am.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This has been a very good series. I would recommend it.  Ms. Charles tells a good story. I did not read these in order, but they were still very good. I would recommend trying to read them in order.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was a good read drawing you in and keeping you interested till the end. The book is good.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I couldn't put this book down once I started.  It's well written and I just can't get enough now to start the second book. I recommend this book to everyone looking for a good read. Enjoy,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I loved this book- actually I've read the whole series already and had to come back to write a review so I could share how good these books are as a whole... I enjoy this genre and was excited to read a series that is a breath of fresh air for the Warewolf theme... I also love that there is a history explained and how the books suck you in. Another awesome thing is that the author offers all of the books for FREE thru Amazon selflessly requesting her readers to donate to their local animal shelters instead. Amazing. Some of the women are a little frustrating @ Times but overall an ADULT series to curl up and read- think 50 shades sexy with action, twists, love & everything else a good read has. 5 stars!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I was glued from the first page. I could not stop reading until I was at the end. I really enjoyed this book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is where it all starts for this series, and made me obsessed with Nicky Charles. Brandy and Reno took forever to come together, but in the end, they finally found each other, and of course lived happily ever. Typical romance story, but this book, and series, is so much more!! I am so impressed with this book and the way Nicky Charles writes. This whole series is a must read, and I would defiantly recommend you start with Bonded.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"It was tough to get started, slow reading and very different style from what I usually pick to read.  Sorry line became more and more involved then I was hooked.  Very different ideas but got my imagination going, think you should give it a read you will be surprised, as I was..",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed all of the seris of the wolves, and the bonus was that they were all free, I hope that Nicky, contimue the seris, because I want to see what happened when she brings everyone together in one book, this was interesting to see how the wolves mate and become partners for life, and didn't even know each other.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Excellent!  That's my rating for this fast paced, action packed story about Lycan's. As this is the prequel to the series, I can't wait to read the next book in the series. This is definitely one author and series that I can't wait to share with friends with like interest in reading materials.  Now on to the next book. Thank you Nicky Charles, I really intrigued by your imagination and writing skills. Janice Mote",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Well written story about different kind of people.  Think &#34;Mr. Spock of Star Trek&#34; and changleings (shape shifters).  In the series this book is #0.5.  The series can be read either in the &#34;timeline&#34; order or mixed up.  They are a stand alone.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved it. The book was intense and the mixture of romance and suspense had me finding it hard to put my kindle down.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The writer keeps, you engrossed in the story, it has so much happening, action, suspense, romance. I  enjoyed  this book.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Wow! I couldn't put this book down. Compelling characters and a riveting tale. Can`t wait to read the next one.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I would not read such again, but found it interesting since I had ordered it without actually reading anything but &#34;Bonded&#34;.  The plot was not too bad for those who enjoy this type reading.  Amazon, so glad you cover the spectrum of reading for all!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Absolutely loved this book and look forward to reading the rest in the series! The characters and story line were sensational.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Thank you, Nicky Charles, for making this available for free.  I have never read books about Lycans before, and found this fascinating.  I quickly got enraptured with the characters and the story.  The downside is that I didn't want to do anything else but read this!  I am on the fourth book now; The Mating and The Keeping held my interest just as much as The Bonding.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was an amazing book. I didn't get much sleep reading it but I can not wait to start the next one.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I think out of all the books, this one was definitely my favorite. I loved these two, and how over time, their relationship developed to what it was. Alot of this first book is you getting the gist and the general idea of the plot that expands through the series. It gives you the foundation for the other books and flows very nicely. They go back and forth with their relationship and it makes you wonder if they really will end up together and get that happy ever after that everyone wants, or if the inevitable will happen and they miss that one opportunity to make a move...Anyone I talk to that is an avid reader like myself, I recommend this series. Especially if you are into paranormal or werewolf series, this one is for you!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Like my title says, I really enjoyed this book. Im used to flying through books in a day or so, but this one took me 2 days since it was so long. (no complaints here!) Cant wait to see how the next book goes.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is part of a 5 book series and I must say that I really liked the series.  It book ties in with the others but if you haven't read the others it's still a good read.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was ok not that great it took me a long time to read it it just ok ....,2
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky Charles does it again. one would think that you would get bored, not the case, just gets more and more interested.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is a story about two people who want one another but fight. Brandy has wanted Reno since she first laid eyes on him but as a student she doesn't think that she even has a shot with him. Reno is fighting his own demons and when they first met he isn't looking at her as much as a demonstrator for his class. As the story progresses you see the main characters fighting what their wolves tell them is the right thing to do for the other. This is a great story about accepting ones self and learning to let go. I would recommend this book to anyone.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This was such a great and different kind of read for me when it comes to werewolves. I mean it's kind of the same I guess but from a rogue werewolf view. I really love the storyline of this book. It did kind of bored me but it wasnt the book it was just cuz I have been reading werewolf books one after another so if you know how that feels then yes but if not then you just got kind of tired of reading about werewolves over and over again. But back to the book I would recommend this to anyone. I did get this book for free and I still don't regret downloading it on to my kindle. But if it isnt for free later on then i will still recommend you to buy it.Good job on the book Nicky Charles. I can't wait to finish the series!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"These books are great.  I was a little confused on the first one until I realized they weren't talking about humans, humans but wolfs. I could not put these books down.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I just loved this book. The dynamic between Reno and Brandi was great and it was action packed. Downloading the next book.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Really enjoyed this story. I loved Brandi and Reno's story, and I also loved that it was spread out over several years. It was so refreshing to read something that doesn't take place over a few days/weeks. They're both strong and fun to read, and every interaction you could feel the love/tension shining through.If you love werewolf stories, then you're going to love this. I have grabbed the next one and am ready to start reading. I also will be donating to my local animal shelter as the author has asked. What a great person to put her work for free, inspiring.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book is a prequel to Mating- but was read after the initial three- I chose to read the books in order written instead of when they took place in timeline- and although some information would have been nice to know from this Prequel- I think I would have enjoyed this story less had I not already known about the Lycans from The Mating, The Keeping and The Finding.New twists to the world of the Lycans- interesting story with good pace and well written.All of her stories do have strong sexual content",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I must say, I'm not one of those people who like werewolf stories. However, once you get into reading this one, its a great read. It flows nicely and the characters are really thought out.Would definitely recommend for anyone to read. I'm moving onto the next book in the story and am hoping its just as well thought out and written.Way to go to the author.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This a great tale of the Lycan world. I love  the feelings it brought out and the everyday struggles laid out for all to experience. The internal battles and physical combats had me clenching and grinning the edges of my couch. Please read this book. Hope you all enjoy.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was a long and intense story. The ending was shocking and unexpected... must read next story now. I am so bored on this storyline that I don't want it to end so long books make me happy when the story is told well. Read this book. Read all of the books by this author.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Werewolves and the twists and problems that they are faced with.  A bit of sex included so if it is a problem for you don't read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and all the others by this author. Free on  kindlefire hd books.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Wish I had more of Charles' books.  So different.  I always like something that gets your mind working as to what will be nexg.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"THIS IS A NEW AUTHOR FOR ME  !!! I really love Kindle free books, it is helping me find new and worth reading authors I would have never have had a chance to read, as I can't afford to buy a book, and then suffer disappointment. As of yet, I have not been disappointed. This book is a definite winner !!  This was a Different type of shifter story, with a new take on werewolves. One I had not ever thought of. The werewolves in this book, are a wonderful , as well as fascinating. They are not the magically adept wolves of other stories. These are more like humans, with human frailties. Their lives are fraught with danger, and living, as everyone else's. They have as many problems as everyone else has, and they find ways to deal with these problem, that are as real, and much like the ways that normal humans. As was proven in this book. I am looking forward to reading more, by Nicky Charles. As you should be too. Nicky Charles deserves much more praise for the writing ability shown here. Keep reading, and encourage others to discover all of the joys of reading. Sharing this book with family and friends, is a great start to that !!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I thought this book was longer and dragged to the good parts but all and all it was as great book.since I finished it in one day.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Bonded was a very intense book!  Great reading!  Like the way Nicky Charles brought out the racism within the species!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I will continue to purchase anything from this author. The writing is great and does not have any boring parts. The information into the history of the Lycan pack was even interesting when most books it seems to be the boring part.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"So this is the prequel to the Law of the Lycan series. I read the others first, so this is the 4th one of Nicky Charles I've read. It is really a book of it's own, but what I liked is it mentioned the main characters from the other books just enough to remember it was a prequel. This storyline was just as good as the other, and really explained what the laws are about. Very interesting, just started it's sequel. I don't think it's a must to read this one before the Mating. It fits very well as a 4th read.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I read all of the five boo'm s because a friend recommend them and they were free I am truly hoping she continues to write great plot could not put down my kindle.  You won't regret reading these.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was a really fun book to read. I have not read much in the warewolf genre, I tend to stick to vampires, but this was a really great start to this series. The male lead was strong, but not overly so, the female lead as well, but in a good way. The plot was good, and there are some interesting sub plots going on that I hope the author carries through the rest of the series.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"When I started this book, I did not think I-  would like it, but I absolutely loved it. I could hardly put it down. It was so good and the love scenes to me were beautiful because they loved each other so much. The love portions were written with such grace and love that they did not bother me at all, and that is saying something for me, because I usually won,t reaOPpd a book with explicit sex scenes in them. Bramomvo to you and now I am ready to read the next one, which is the Mating, I think. I have four of them to read and am looking forward to starting the next one..",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky does a great job of introducing some of the main characters to appear in her later books. The haze is lifted from a good part of headquarters and their difficulties in dealing with these passionate and emotional beings. throw in a little danger with a love story, some mystery and a really bad guy who needs killing and you have a terrific read.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"A friend of mine told me about this book series. I've read all the books in this series, and they just keep getting better! Plus, they're free? The author just sakes that you make a donation to a food bank or animal shelter. Umm....OK, both are great causes! So Brandi is probably my favorite female character in this whole series. Reno and Brandi are great together! I like the way the love/hate relationship was played out. I hope you keep this series going Nicky!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"If any author should be a millionaire from their books, Nicky Charles would be the one. Nicky's creative writing and story lines are absolutely one of THE best I have ever read. Keep up the amazing work Nicky!!!!!!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book was really good and entertaining.  Nicky is a little long winded with the details, but it was still truly good. Brandi got on my nerves a little because some of her decisions and thought process was naive and silly.  Reno was hott, lovable, and truly a good wolf at heart!I hope Nicky eventually charge something for her full length novels. She's truly talented and sweet. I feel like I owe her for all her hard work. She's in a league all of her own.I'm donating to some animal organization just for all the hard work Nicky don't charge for (don't care if its a hobby). Its wonderful, and I'll be happy to buy her books in the future.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"So, what an amazing story!  I could not put it down.  Such a great tale of love, fate, friendship and the stupid things we do to ourselves. Totally relatable.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I enjoyed this book very much. I think the storyline was strong and so were the characters. I read all the books in this series and will read the entire series. Great job Nicky Charles!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I really think the author did an excellent job at portraying the feelings of each of the characters. The twist and turns are an added bonus to the story. You think one thing and it ends up the opposite. I had a hard time finding a place to stop reading for the night, just one more chapter. I love the descriptions that are used. I could feel like I was right there.  Loved it.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was great I hope the next book have a continue with Damien and some how i believe Beth is still alive,I am hoping that's how the next story go but I have this inkling that Damien story will be even better than this one,just like the mating it was great!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was my second read through of Bonded, and it was still a good read. It starts at an academy for werewolves where Brandi is finishing up coursework toward a career with the PR arm of Lycan Link, the police force of the weres. Reno is an enforcer who is doing a rotation as instructor. They meet and bam!  Instant attraction. But Reno does not do relationships.  His psych eval says he is dangerous, on the edge, at risk for going rogue. So he can't afford to bring someone into his life, for their own protection. Except, he can't get Brandi out of his mind, or his life, since he works with her. The plot takes lots of twists and turns. Charles' books are not predictable and I recommend the series.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Similar to the other books in the series. However, I had a hard time reading through some of it. A lot of inner dialogue  and jumps in time throughout the story.  Not quite my thing. I felt like it was a little slow midway through the book.I do appreciate Nicky Charles' books though, so I will keep reading.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"It is a great book - very captivating, but I guess too mich luist for me. If I put aside the lust-filled pages, it was a great story line and was very interesting, certainly not what I was expecting and kept me on the edge of my chair. I found that it was a great book but not exactly suitable for all ages. But a tremendous read indeed.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I read Mating, and have backtracked to reading BONDED.This sets up Ms. Charles world, although I didn't miss this beggining when I read #2.I enjoyed this one very much. Reno is what an Alpha wolf should be...even his clueless moments!Brandi is submissive...and sometimes I wanted her to just TELL HIM ALREADY, lol.But getting THERE is half the fun. And it was fun watching the way these two come together.There are some tearful scenes here as well. Those scenes set up for book 2.5.I'm very impressed with this author, she doesn't charge, or only .99 for her books. She could be getting lots more. They really are that good.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This story kept me engaged from beginning to end. It was difficult to put it down and go to bed, I kept reading hours after my normal bedtime.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I got this book because it was free. I was expecting something like a novella or a short story. Bonded is a complete novel and a very well written one. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to start on the next one!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Excellent story about werewolves and their laws and way of life.I didn't think I would be interest in this type of story. Lots love and adventure. Enjoyed it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really liked this one.  It was fast paced and kept me guessing.  A good read for anyone that likes sci fi.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was an excellent one that keeps you guessing and the story is definitely an interesting one that hooks the reader.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have always loved the vampire, werewolves books and this is no exception, I loved this book, the characters are great, and i felt like i was in the story with them. My emotions through this book were like a roller coaster, one minute im laughing, the next minute im crying, I think i went through every emotion possible!!!! Reading betrayed right now and from what ive read so far im loving that also. So very glad i found this series. Great job Nicky Charles!!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a great story. Hated Damien's happenings in the end. Cannot wait for the next book. I've already downloaded it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Loved the other three. Then went to this book and loved it even more!  The story grabbed me right away. REvery time I was interrupted from reading I was  saying, ""but I'm in a really good spot in the book!"" Love Reno and Brandi.  Like how this story was  different from the others being about a rogue instead of an alpha or beta. Also love how it was about lycans in general with the threat of purists instead of a single enemy against one pack and the threat of Lycans exposed.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I love a good werewolf story. Brandi and Reno have a lot of problems right from the get go. An accidental bonding between them makes an already awkward relationship more difficult for Brandi, since it is one way. The two seem like oil and water, but when things get dangerous for Brandi, Reno can't leave her to fight it on her own. I would recommend his book to others.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I cannot get enough of your books! So glad to have come across your books, I look forward to reading all of them, and then I will be left hanging for more!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Great intro to the series. While some od the content does seem reiterated, it will definitely keep you interested to see how it ends. Be aware that it is a very lengthy book ... It's not just an overnight read!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,A wow for a free kindle book.  I didn't expect to enjoy it that much.  I hope she continues to write.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Loved this series.  After getting hooked on the first FREE one I bought the rest.  Great series, kept me waiting for more with each book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have just finished the whole series. I really love this author's work and look forward to her next installment. All of the books in he series have the same great qualities: action, suspense, romance and heat!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,this is one of many in a series.... google Nicky Charles and find out the sequence and read them all,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I had a good time reading this book and I couldn't wait to get back to it whenever life interrupted. If you love romance, werewolves, and more bad guys than you can shake a stick at this is the book for you!Not to mention the wonderfully talented author has made all of her work free and would like you to donate to your local food bank or animal shelter instead! Total class act!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,an excellent setup for the rest of the series.I read this out of order and it stands up well as a stand alone book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Can't wait to read the next one. I especially was touched by the authors paying it forward, by saying in lieu of paying fir book donate to an animal shelter.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Each book gets better and better. And I feel connected to each character. This one hit home for me since my husband and I spent 24 years thinking the other didn't want the other one. haha. life's funny. If we are just honest with ourselves then love can rule.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I chose this rating because it drugged in so.e places but all in all it was a good read.  It kept you wanting to know what happen next.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.  Nice job Nicky.  Nice job.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,it's amazing how you can get attached to the characters. it's so sad about Damien...now I need to read the next one to find out:),5
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved the story. A full length novel that's written the way they should be written not 20 or 30 pages like some authors.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Thanks for putting so much thought into this book. It has some of everything. The story line is not lacking like most shifter novels and has a believable feel to it. I also like the lead into other characters for future books. Now on to read The Mating. I'll let you know what I think. AND for all those who love shape shifter with an erotic side you will enjoy this story.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Thank you for spinning a most engrossing, fast paced, well crafted tale...I sweated with the central characters through all of the tribulations--both personal and professional.  I laughed in the I lighter moments when the foibles of their human side reminded me how alike all people are and I rejoiced in their triumphs.  It had to deliberately remind myself this was not a tale of people I know because I straits and behaviors known to me in people I DO know in real life.  Look forward to more from your pen (LOL...or rather maybe computer)",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This series shares a little bit of everything with the reader, suspense, mystery, love, and a little bit of sex, and of course hot Alpha males, yumm&#8230; I like everything about it. The character development is superb, I really didn&#8217;t know who the bad person was until almost at the end so the suspense was well written. Now I am reading the last of the available books (The Finding im at 60%) and would like to recommend the order for new to the series readers. This is what the author calls the Chronological order:  Bonded, The Mating, The Keeping, Betrayed, and The Finding. I would not follow the story stands because there are references in Betrayed of events developed in the other books. The Finding is definitely the last one because it reunites most of the characters.  I have to say I like both H/h and side characters that we will learn about later in the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,this was the beginning of the series and it was interesting and had you wanting to know more from the first book thru the ending.  looking for other good series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Waiting for more from this author. Nicky Charles. Great writer and keeps interest in reading what she writes. I want more.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very good read.Fast paced.New subject matter. Very engaging characters. Good love interest. Strong male and female role models.,2
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a great read. I really loved this book. I downloaded all five of them and now need to know which one to read next. I think this is a good series and I love the characters. The concept is more than just a wolf series you can relate to the things that are happening as well. While the series are free here's your chance to read something great.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I downloaded this book for free with the other books in the series because I had never read anything by this author and the premise looked interesting. The mythology behind the story was good and the characters were likable but the execution could have been tighter. Elements of the story were repetitive,especially in regards to the feelings of the main characters which were shared over and over in the chapters. The book could have benefited from some judicious editing,some sections were a little long and as a result my interest started to wander. That being said I read the book to experience a new author and while I may never read this particular book again it ended on a cliffhanger and I will read the following book in the series (Betrayed)to see what happens next.And in the end that is the goal of all authors to have people read their books to the end.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book starts it all and right from the very beginning I was hooked.  The characters are strong and determined to do their jobs for Lycan Link, the ruling body for the werewolves.  Some are killed, some fall in love and some good ones die.  That's all I'm going to say I don't want to spoil it.  It is very important to read these in an order that keeps the story flowing.  Check the author's blog as she gives 3 options.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Pretty cool.  A nice flow from book to book. Going to find the next one so I can find out about Cassie.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,"Characters: Brandi starts off as an insecure college graduate with a crush on the amazing Enforcer, Reno.  Her best friend sets them up twice which leads to a mutual attraction and an accidental blood bond.  Having decidedly different political opinions forces them into an argumentative relationship; the only peace they ever find is when they are making love.  Unfortunately, they continue to verbally disagree with each other for over three years before Reno FINALLY listens to his inner wolf.Writing Style: Definitely in need of some serious editing and I confess to skipping a lot.  There are some repetitive parts and some too detailed parts that need to go, but for free, I am not complaining!  The overall writing is very good.Plot: Takes place in a werewolf society that has laws in place to treat all fairly only a group called the Purist does not want half breeds to live despite their own pure line having diseases because of too much inbreeding.  Enforcers make sure the laws are being followed and Damage Control makes sure the humans do not realize werewolves live among them.  Reno does not belong to a pack because his wolf is considered Rogue and is an Enforcer who falls for Brandi but does not trust himself to love her without endangering her.  Brandi becomes a Damage Control officer and ends up entering Reno's life on a constant basis and has a tumultuous relationship with him while defending half breeds from Purists.Romance: IS WHY I READ and could have been better.  Brandi and Reno spend a lot of time apart, but when they get together, sparks fly!  I would have preferred months passing instead of years, but since I got my HEA, I am Okay with itSex and Violence Rating: R - Descriptive Sex, not much Swearing, Some killing5 Stars - Loved it and reading the sequel NOW!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Fun book to read.  I liked the idea of the enforcers.  A few things seemed a little out of character.  Nice love story until the end.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,"Didn't realize there was a prequel to the mating until after I read it, and 2 others. So I went a little out of order, but it didn't really matter much. Loved this one and love all the banter that went on between the characters.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was not a novel, it was a textbook on the history, and inner working of a madeup ware sect called the Lycans.  Classifying this as a paranormal romance has you wondering where is the romance.  For the entire book we learn about the puritans, the enforcers and the dc group, little to no romance between the two main characters, and a whopping three.... Yes 3 weak sex scenes in the entire book.  Boring... Don't waste your time or money.... For me it was free.",1
B00BT0J8ZS,"Excellent read, exciting plot, and complex and loveable Characters. Really enjoyed Bonded and can't wait to read the next book! Am hooked!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I was lucky to have found this book, I love the unique storyline and the in depth characters and their backgrounds. The story is action packed, and the love scenes are steaming",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is an amazing book and Nicky Charles books are great but sad to see that Amazon is exploiting this, Nicky Charles books are free she does not charge, you can go to all other web sites such as B and N and download for free. This author has never charged for her books. Granted they are quite long over 1000 pages but an amazing read!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book was a little too long and drawn out. I think the book could have been shorter. However, I finished it, but it took me several weeks. I would read it off and on, instead of reading it straight through.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I never wanted to know about werewolf bureaucracy. This book was boring. They weren't werewolves, they were office workers. Sure, you can call them werewolves, but I can call the guy in the next cubicle a starship trooper. Doesn't mean he is one. This was long, repetitive and tedious. I'm a huge werewolf fan, but this was brutally hard to tolerate. I got 40% of the way through the book and I just can't finish it. You can't make me. There are laws against torture in this country.",2
B00BT0J8ZS,Can't wait to start next book!  Interesting series that keeps you thinking. Would recommend to other. Good book and author.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I've now read all of the books in this series. What I first want to say applies to all of the books in the series. I had to go to the author's website to try and figure out the best order to read them in. In the end, I went with chronological order: Bonded, The Mating, The Keeping, Betrayed, then The Finding. Overall, I think the stories were interesting. Clearly, if I didn't like them I wouldn't have continued to read the entire series. I was prompted to read them in the first place because of the good reviews and the price (can't beat FREE)! However, I can only give them 3 stars because they were so overly redundant I found myself skipping over a great deal and wanting to get straight to the point. I think they could have each been shortened by 30+ pages without losing anything of value. Many things were unnecessarily repeated and actually took away from the plot development. The author did a good job developing her characters and the storyline, so there was no need to repeat things over and over again. I'm thinking specifically of how she may have told a story about something that happened in a character's past multiple times throughout the text. If you told it once, you can just reference it or put a one liner in that will prompt the reader to remember. I felt she didn't give the readers enough credit to put things together or their own or connect the dots. Everything was explained in great detail too many times and some of the stories felt dragged out. Still, I was drawn into the stories and connected with the characters (hence the 3 stars). As other reviewers have said, these books are available free elsewhere if Amazon is charging for them!With that being said, Bonded was probably by favorite book in the series. I really liked the characters, Brandi and Reno, and loved the way their relationship developed. This was also a great introduction to their lycan world. It was a nice refreshing twist on a common theme. I was especially excited to see these characters return later on in the series. Although the ""romance"" part may be lacking for some, I thought it was well done. It wasn't your typical love hate relationship, but it went well with the overall story and everything else that was going on in the character's lives. This book may have explained a lot about the werewolves and how they operate, but as the first book in a series that should be expected.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,Excellent short story which if free! Book is very good.  I enjoyed it immensely as I did the mating.  I wish Nicky would continue with the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed this book. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  I liked the characters and the length of  the story.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"It had me hooked from the start, very exciting a lot of drama but so so good. The book went on an on I couldn't put it down. I just wished it did take 3 years for him to figure it out, but it's a guy thing I guess.  It's a wonderful book.  What a great job!!!!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really enjoyed reading the entire series. The story line seemed to flow and I think it pure reading pleasure.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Lately I've been disappointed in the free and 99 cent books I've read from amazon. But I decided to check this book out anyways. And I'm so glad I did. This is an awesome book. I can easily see this as a book that gets turned into a movie.  At least I can wish. It has action, suspense, and of course romance in it.  I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I did not want this book to end and thankfully I didn't have to because there are 5 books in this series. I want more. Excellent story line and writing skill. I was spell bound and could not put it down until the end. Ms. Charles made me feel like I was right there with the characters in the story. Thank You for such a good book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,bonded is great it gives you some back story on the other books in the series. but is great all by itself great read loved it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"THIS IS THE BEST SERIES OF BOOKS i HAVE EVER READ, i HAD TO READ EVERY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE IT WAS SO DRAWNING",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I really loved The Mating, but I really think Bonded was better. The story was fascinating. The Purists, Damien and Beth, Al, Tabi, and, of course, Reno and Brandi, all made great storylines that wove, clashed, & finally, meshed together in a splendid, explosive, and tender way. It was happy, up, frustrating, down, heated, and sometimes sad the way the characters interacted with each other and with the reader. I haven't enjoyed a romance novel this much in years! Keep up the good work, Nicky Charles! I want more!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am so glad I came across this book! I could not put it down! Great/Strong characters, great storyline, and well written... Thank goodness author stated at the beginning that this book was written in Canadian English(example: practice in book is spelled practise) or I would have thought bad spelling/grammar. Highly recommend to those who like werewolf theme stories. Can't wait to start next book in series!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I could not stop reading this one! I enjoyed the story and found it well written. I am enjoying every book that Nicky Charles has written. Kudos to you for your imagination and fantastic way of telling a story!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am ready for more of this series. The Law of the Lycans is full of so many twist and turns. Bonding, mating, keeping, alfa,beta and the list goes on and on. LOVE this series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This isn't my usual type of story but I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. I can't wait to continue the series. It was fast paced and exciting with a perfect amount of romance to tie it together. Skillfully written fantastic beach read. Would highly recommend to at least try,being that the whole series is free.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,It was a pleasure to have chanced upon an author who appears to have seriously tried to polish her work before self-publishing.  The gifting of this series for free really marks her love of stories and the sharing of them.  Unfortunately she recently had a small stroke and is looking toward retirement so please buy her next book in the series when it becomes available.  I know I will as I am really caught up with the characters and their relationships.  Thanks Nicky for this really excellent series.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Enjoyed it. Good premise, but sometimes a little repetitive. Did not have an overall negative impact on the story. Good character development as well.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Will find and read all of Nicky Charles' ycon series books. Makes you almost wish you were a &#34;she-wolf&#34; and wonder where are these men!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Well developed characters. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys the Werewolf Genre. The settings were vivid and well detailed.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky Charles, has done a really really great job with this series, way to I have enjoyed reading them thanks",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book was full of entertaining characters that made you fall in love with each one. The plot was well written to keep you reading and in the end you want more. I love how the writer gives you enough info about the Lucian society with out boring you or losing your interest. I highly recommend you read the book, when you don't want be interrupted. Because when you start reading you will not want to put the book down.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,It's been a long time since I started a book that I had such a hard time putting down when I couldn't finish it in one sitting.  Would very highly recommend.  It's a fascinating setting of a society trying to stay hidden and survive it's own internal enemies.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I rated this 5 stars because it was non stop action, if a story grabs me in the first chapter and can keep my interest until the end and leaving me satisfied and happy about the story it gets this rating. I can't wait to read the next book in this series and other books by Nicky Charles. If you like books about shifters then you will not want to miss this book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The author did a fabulous job of providing history on the tribes and the manner in which they interacted with humans. The book covered all bases for me. It had intrigue, mystery, love, deception, espionage, sorrow and graphic sex.This is a long read so be prepared for some sleepless nights.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I don't normally read paranormal books.  That being said, I REALLY enjoyed this book.  I devoured it.  I read it while I ate.  I read it past my bedtime.  I took my Kindle with me so I could read it whenever I had a free moment.  I hope the rest of the series is just as good.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really like these types of paranormal books; especially any by Nicky Charles.  All of the Lycan series have been good.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Nicky has an amazing series so be sure to read all in the series and read in order!  All of her stories have amazing writing to let the audience experience the story not just read it- and she does this all while asking nothing in return but donating to your animal shelter or homeless shelter! Way to go!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I thought I was going to read a normal romance story. Very strange story but interesting. If you like reading about the unusual then give it a try. Not a story to read in one day.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the rest of the series.  I also like that the author asks for donations for local animal shelters...The book is a great read and very enjoyable to read...take a chance and enjoy the book and I look forward to reading ""the mating""",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book is a very fun and interesting take on Lycan folklore. That he characters are engaging and the story moves along well. Can't wait to read the next one!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,As I said before this is a great series I read the first one because it was free would have paid for the rest,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Not being a fan of Lycan stories I gave this one a try because 1 it was free, and 2 the awesome reviews. Soo glad I took a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are engaging and the story is full of twists and turns. Loved it! Can't wait to get started on the other books of this series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was the last book in the series but a story well worth on its own It gives you a better glimpse of where it all started and the three main hero's met.Nickey Charles has away of drawing you in making the plot believable and entertaining to the very end. I loved the strong characters and the way they developed as humans and shapeshifters.I discovered it was part of a series of four books I had to read them as well. I was not dissapointed at all. Read them all a few times.A book I can recommend to all lovers of paranormal romance mixed with suspense and budding relationships.A wonderful read,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Only Nicky Charles could write a riveting, gut-wrenching, tear jerker that keeps you turning the pages. One of the best story and character development. I love how she gives textbook information and background but keeps the story moving forward. You fall in love with Reno Smith and want him to get the girl. The action is great in this story...found myself saying now that was great and that could really happen. All of your senses will be delighted with this story line. Get a glimpse of Kane & Ryne before they were Alphas! Nicky knows how to tie it all together.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have read all but one of these books. Nicky Charles does a good job with her characters. Her plots are a bit obvious, but as this series is heavy on the romance, it is to be expected.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,For a second there I thought everything was going to he'll. But no it just had to be a romantic mystery.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,So far I've read 4. On to the next book. Love these free books. Hope this lady keeps writing moree,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I really loved the story line and the twist in the ending was amazing. Definitely will recommend. Can't wait to read the rest!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"It was a good story...it dragged sometimes, especially in the beginning.  Brandi is a strong lead woman character.  Reno is a sexy wolf!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Started out slow and leaves you hanging at the end but it was a good read if you want to read the series,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This prequel is of Reno denying his feelings for Brandi because he thought he was close to being a rogue wolf. Yet not knowing how to stay away from her. They met in college called the academy which its participants are wolves that are difficult to control. So I guess you can say boot camp for wolves, but also for wolves who want more out of life in some form of career. Well anyway Brandi was a student assistant to Reno for a demo class on self defense in which Brandi scratched his face by accident then ingested his blood, blood bonding them.I gave it a 3 star because it was a decent read. Reno and Brandi working to catch purist fanatics yet having a hard time holding their feelings back, was interesting to read. The intimate scenes were ok, not hardcore and few and far between. Giving the story some suspense what they would do next.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"The beginning of the saga, that really makes everything make sense. The story begins at the ""academy"" and how an accidental bonding affected the lives of an enforcer and a student. This is Reno' s and Damien's stories and their respective relationships with Beth and Brandy. I can't wait to find out more about Damien and how his story ends. An entertaining read.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I like the story line of all Nicky Charles' books.  However, I couldn't give them a higher rating because sometimes there is so much sex it overwhelms the story.  I don't mind a little of it, but too much just makes the story boring.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I never thought I'd be so into paranormal romance but this book changed all that. Love Reno and Brandi's relationship and I'm extremely saddened about what happened with Damien.I felt like I was really in there with all the characters and  shared all the emotions that they were experiencing. I'm eagerly looking forward to reading the rest of the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I found the first book ""the mating"" and loved it so much that I had to get the rest of the series. This is an awesome series and I recommend it to everyone!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky Charles has created a complete society with &#34;Bonded&#34; the backstory was riveting. I can't wait to see where it all goes. I'm hoping the romance is stronger in he next books. I'll be making a donation to BRIT, the rescue group I work with and have foster for.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is the first Nicky Charles book I've read and I can't wait to read the others. The storyline kept my interest throughout the whole book and the roller coaster of emotions from Reno and Brandi were very well written. Would recommend this book to any one who has a thing for Lycans and loves a good story.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have enjoyed this series, even though the closest thing to reading about wearwolves was the Twilight Series I did enjoy this set of stories.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book was awesome! Packed with love, romance, action, and humor. It was a great read. You could read this one before the law of the Lycans and not give anything away, but if you read the first three before the prequel you will know something about the end, yet it is still shocking. Highly recommend!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Once you start the 1st of this series its very hard to set it down. Very good story line and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Something I will reread  again just cause it was that darn good!!!!!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have read a lot of werewolves novels and this was great!Another take on werewolves, the author decided to another route.I loved the fact that I could download all 5 books in the series for free. Lucky me it's long weekend!Jones and Smith rocked, can't wait to read the others!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I read this as if it were book 3 but it should be read as book 1. Still, if you read it out of order you'll be okay because it stands alone.I enjoyed most of this but there were times I couldn't help think it was taking too long for the couple in this book to get together.  This author likes to continuously replay the same issue and scenarios over repeatedly.  It tends to get boring and frustrating.And the ending of this could have been much better.  It introduces us to the new upcoming book (another reason reading this as book 3 is okay) because the main character in that book is the one that ends this one.The ending felt very rushed and had little detail.Overall I still think it was an okay book so I'm rating it 3 stars - possibly 3.5 on Amazons scale.  I'll most likely read the next book but not going to lie - if the same issues continue I won't read another.  One can only take the hamster wheel so long before the ride has to end! :-)",3
B00BT0J8ZS,love the nicky charles books on lycans! they are well written and even though in twos; you dont necessarily have to read both to enjoy one.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Absolutely enjoyed this book. I got caught up in all of the characters and the storyline. Finishing this review and starting the next book.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Nicky Charles has found a new fan ! I fell in love with the characters and their plight.  Looking for more,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"A prequel in the Law of the Lycans series, the characters may be a bit stereotypical (masculine 'tough cop' and feminine 'cares about people') but interesting none-the-less. The addition of a permanent 'blood bond'  to the typical wolf 'mate for life' concept is intriguing, and the 'accidental' and 'unbeknownst' nature of it in the story made for a nice twist in a sometimes ""paused"" relationship.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I'm still trying to figure out how I even came upon this story. Then when I clicked I saw that all the stories listed were free and has so many reviews!!.. It was an instant download for me.I knew it was Paranormal, but not much else, didn't read the sample or any thing. Then I had to figure out which one do I start with first.. So I was directed to a site that recommended to start with Bonded.. thus beginning my addiction to this series.. Wow! I love when I'm pleasantly surprisedI did not know what to expect. I didn't read any of the reviews I decided to take a chance and jump right in. As I read I realize I was getting alot of background info on Lycans, Halves, Rogues, Purists etc.... I wasn't sure it would keep my interest, but I trekked on. Then we're introduced to Reno & Brandiand then my interest peaks. I loved their banter I love how even though the attraction was instant it took awhile ... like 3yrs or up until 98% of the story for them to get their act together..ha!ha!. Well it's more like Reno figuring out where his heart lies. The action, suspense, the time lapse all played out beautifully and kept me on edge. Then there's Damien, I just knew before the end that something big was going to happen with him.. I felt it as I was reading. And now I'm on to Mating, which I've read is the next order of reading.I was thoroughly satisfied.. I'm blown away by this author's attention to detail and I love how dedicated and consistent the characters were. And to think this story is free! amazing, simply amazing.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I liked the storyline of this book. The book has twists and turns along the way, that kept me on the edge of my seat.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed the alpha character more than the heroine in this story. However, it was still an awesome read. With the passage of time extended throughout the book, each chapter takes on a more intense level of suspense. Being that the suspense is primarily between the main characters, outer conflicts seem to only carry the book along for the sake of the romance story. That said, those outer conflicts are interesting and the Lycan specifics are sufficient to carry the reader. It made me want to read more.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Great suspense. Excellent story line.  Th book was very well written.  Nicky Charles can certainly keep things interesting.  Can't wait to read another one,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"There are many books out right new about werewolves, vampires, etc but this author makes the characters come to life and makes the stories believable. This is an author to add to my collection. If you're a fan of this genre, give her a try. Even if you're not a fan of this genre, they are still great love and family stories, with a little paranormal thrown in",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I was surprised to find such a wonderful series about werewolves. It is hot, with tons of action.. good guys versus bad guys stuff. I look forward to reading more. Thank you Nicky for sharing your talent with us.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,of this writer - I cant wait for book 4 as I would like to know more of what happens with Damon.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was really enjoyable. Truly great characters and storyline. I am happy to write that this is the second book I have read from this author and am really looking forward to reading more of their books.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,The story was spectacular. The reason I didn't give it a five star rating is because parts of it were flat. The majority of the story was great then it would bog down in little details. Overall a great story.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,WOW - I can't say anymore than that. I hated the book to end!This series as got to be my all time favorite story line n I can't wait to get further into The Finding and the rest of the books.Thank you Nicky Charles!!!:))))),5
B00BT0J8ZS,"(mrs.featherpicker reviewing)I've never really gotten into the Werewolf themed stories until now. I am so caught up with the characters in these stories! The author has done an excellent job with story lines and this one is just perfect. The ""believability"" of the people is easy to handle mainly because the story itself is just so well written. I'm very impressed and would, and will, highly recommend these stories and the author to all! Anytime a story grabs me so much that I wake up in the morning and can't wait to start reading again, well, I gotta' tell ya', that's darn good writing. Thank you Nicky Charles!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I liked this book. The werewolf universe is fascinating and the dialogue seems real amongst the characters. Overall this book makes me want to know more about what happens next, just as a great read should. I recommend not only this book but the entire series to fantasy readers everywhere.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,I started reading this series and even though they were quite long; I thoroughly enjoyed curling up and reading these books.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I guess if people just discussed their feelings and asked each other about their thoughts, the book would be boring.  There is plenty of other storyline and of course a lot of heat.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was super duper fantastic from the start to the very end of the story.  I was totally engrossed in the characters and the storyline.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book of this great series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,The only thing I can say is WOW!!! I absolutely cannot get enough of Nicky Charles books... There has never been a series that kept me intrigued enough to track the books down. Cannot wait for more!!!!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Amazing how the background to the series was developed. Great plot line, the character development and growth was incredible. I had an extremely difficult time putting this book down.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book took me a long time to read.  I found myself skipping chapters because of all the long dragged out dialogue.  Reading should be a pleasure, not a chore.I'm going to give ""The Mating"" a chance.  Hopefully It will be more entertaining.",1
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed this book, although a paranormal romance, the lessons in intolerance are very real and well written, thank you.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky Charles is an excellent writer. All her books I have read have had me enthralled, it grabs my attention from start to finish.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"It's so nice to come across a story that captures your attention, and stands a part from the everyday fanfare. Nice original story.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"truely excellent. this book exceeds many that we are paying through the nose for. have no problems donating to my animal shelter cos thats agiven anyway. great book, characters are interesting and I'll def. be reading all of them.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Still reading, have enjoyed your books, and will donate to the cause. thanks for putting them on Amazon,  And free at that.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This is a great sequel and Nicky knows how to grab you right away so you can't put the book down. Really enjoy her writing.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Great story, compelling characters, a bit of a drag in the middle waiting for the &#34;punch line&#34; but all in all a good read.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Best to start this book on vacation or when you can pull an all-nighter. Will gladly make a donation to my local food bank Nicky Charles!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I loved this story and can't wait to read the next story,what happened to Damien? I would recommend this to my family.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I read other books in the series and this one gave a lot of background information about the history of the charactersLoved it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was surprising and unexpected. Really great book. I would recommend it strongly to anyone who wants  a paranormal romance.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have taken the advice of others and read ""Bonded"" first.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The genre is new to me, so the details were interesting.  Nicky Charles has an enjoyable, easy to read style that kept me very interested.  The characters were believable and I liked their drawn out 'courtship'.I will start ""Betrayed"" this evening.I highly recommend this book!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book will keep you so into it that you will forget things like eating and sleeping. The author does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a good book.I will be getting the others in the series. The characters in the book were really good.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am really into your books, they are wonderful, exciting, romantic and  just enough suspect to keep me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I chose this book because the title captured my attention. From the beginning th author proved to be an exceptional writer. I couldn't stop reading and found myself forcing my kindle down so I could sleep. I enjoyed the first book and will be starting the next one upon finishing this review! If you are looking for a great love story that deals with suspense and fantasy than you must read this!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,So amazing!! Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and couldn't put it down. Will read again once I finish the rest. Can't wait!!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,The saga continues i recommend all of the books in this series there's so many twists and turns that it keeps you guessing. I found that in this book however the beginning was a bit show for me with all the book reading(i don't warn my 2 day 2 much and give anything away) however it picks up and ends strong just like the rest of the books i have one more left and I'm dreadful of the ending of this series,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Five stars are not enough.  Just could not put this one down.  Great writing, great characters.  Was t more from this author.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book keeps you guessing.  It is a wonderfully written book to become lost in.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I'm not a fan of paranormal books but I have to say that I enjoyed this book. It's well written and is a good romantic suspense story.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,One of the best books that I have read in a long time.  The characters were all very interesting and intriguing.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book was a great read.  I would definitely recommend it.  If you like this book you must read The Keeping.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I can not say enough about Nicky Charles werewolf book series.  It will draw you in and you will keep reading every last one of her series.  Make sure you read in the proper order.  Check her website for the reading order.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This fresh new take on werewolves and how they are synergistic within the human psyche is amazing and you can feel it.  It's a palpable feeling throughout.  You can imagine having your own inner wolf and how fun it would be so much that you want to be a werewolf.  There is no painful change and yet the politics, and were culture are very real with very real repercussions.  I can't put these books down, and Nicky Charles has made them free!  Amazing.  So much work for such a gift.  I actually wish she'd charge and then have a percentage of proceeds toward animal rescue.  Great work!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"As several other reviewers note, start with this book first. There is background information about the Lycans and their Book of Law that helps to put the other parts in perspective. I suspect that you will want to read them all once you start.Most werewolf and other ""shifter"" books bore me to death. Nicky Charles proves to be an exception to the typical works of the genre that are mostly little more than bodice rippers with fur. One criticism of her well formed world is that the use of erotic and fairly graphic scenes is a bit over the top. Personally I think the works would be better without the erotica and would also be great for a younger audience. Just be advised that these are full of adult situations and may not be suitable for younger readers or those squeamish about overt sexuality.The Lycans series formulated a whole culture with quite varied rules and an interesting blend of rather odd customs from arranged marriage to highly modern technology. Character development is good and the roles in Lycan society are well developed. Another incentive to read the entire series is that they are free or extremely inexpensive as well as being good reads.I won't go into the plot but I recommend that even if this genre is not your usual cup of tea that you give Charles' series a chance.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Bonded (Prequel to The Mating)This was a good full sized novel, with in depth character and relationship development.  There was plenty of action, suspense, love and angst.  I am looking forward to the next installment. Thank you Nicky Charles for a great free novel.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,These are so good and unique! What a great movie or tv special these would make! I thank the author for such great books.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Nicky can hold your interest and curiosity in this book. Just sit back and enter another world of love. I honestly could not put this book down.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I love paranormal stories but I usually don't read were stories.  I had some reservations about this one but decided to stick it out because of a friend`s recommendations.  I'm glad I did. This was an awesome book. I can't wait to read the next one!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"just finished the the first book (will be reading the next book after this review). i have to say that i loved this book VERY much. i liked how the author made the book take over the course of 3 years yet kept a fast pace. There was a lot of action, occasionally i wanted to slap Brandi and tell Reno the truth. The end of the book, god...my...feels...man, my f-ing feels. over all the book (in my opinion) was a success, especially for a free book***Spoiler ALERT***why did Beth have to die? i mean come on! the ending almost had me in tears",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Well guess I should have read this one first, wish they would number them in order. Any way it's a great story. Love the drama and it's very exciting.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Just like all of Nicky Charles books this one keeps you on the edge of your seat. Adventure, mystery and romance in one great book and series. I highly recommend these books!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very hot erotic romance by an author I had not read before but have totally enjoyed the concept of werewolves and the lives and laws very different.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This whole series is just amazing! This one had the most angst I think. I read it last and I know that's the proper order, but had I known what I do now, I would have read it second. It explains a lot about the other books.Thank you to Nicky Charles for giving us this series for free!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I became so caught up in these characters that I had a hard time putting the book down. It's been awhile since I've had that total dedication to finishing a story so quickly. I would recommend this book to other readers who enjoy fantasy stories, keeping in mind that there are several scenes of sexual encounters.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I downloaded all 5 books for free. I was hesitant at first because I don't read about werewolves. But I am so glad I did. The stories were well thought out, the characters were well established, the stories flowed smoothly. I really want to read more on Damien. Hopefully, there will be other stories that I can delve into.There were a few grammical errors, but it didn't deter from the story. Thank you for such great stories.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Brandi finds herself attracted to an instructor at her were school but the attraction turns out to be more than that. Jobs and more will not allow them to leave each other alone. When they are thrown together the sparks fly. Add in a little mystery and some deception to get a story that is more than just a romance.Now this story is advertised as the prequel to The Mating. It is, but it is not all about the characters that you meet in The Mating. You basically get a little of Kane and his brother. That's all. So don't expect to read details about the younger years of those men or anyone else. You just get a little bit of that. That being said, it is still a very good story and can be read before or after The Mating. It will not affect anything you read for either one.The characters in this book were very unique though I wanted to slap the two main characters. I mean come on. Forget what you think you are or what you think the other person is thinking. Talk to each other. Then again, if they communicated we wouldn't have such a good book. Still, drove me crazy.There are some hot scenes and a little language, but overall it was clean. It focused more on the mental and emotional side of the relationship and the mystery surrounding Purists than it did with intimate scenes. They were there but were solely to add to the plot. I don't like sex scenes just to have the physical interactions. It has to bring value to the story.This is a paranormal story about werewolves. It's not a love triangle. It's not someone fighting their genetic makeup. This is about people coming to grips with their own lives, their own feelings, and learning to love others.I enjoyed this story. It was different than The Mating, but in a good way. Don't go into it thinking it is the same, and you'll find that you'll want more.Note: I purchased this book with my own funds with no expectation from anyone else for a positive review.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,I couldn't barely sleep for days and found myself at work wondering what would happen next.I can't wait to read the next book.  What happened next?????,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Wow...the ending of this book was so sad. Did not see it coming. This book started out slower than the rest in the series but ended up being pretty good. I think this series could go on and on. I have enjoyed this author's books and am still amazed they are free. I could see these being a series on tv. Each book ends with something dramatic and sets up for the next book. Ready to get on with the next book...,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I liked this book. The story was easy to follow.  The purist are a scary group.  It makes you wonder what else can happen,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Interesting story.  I didn't know much about Werewolves bot this story carried me through to the end.  Quite an enjoyable read.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I downloaded this book for free and what an amazing read!  The plot was full of suspense and I really cared about the characters. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Once again Nicky Charles has given us, her readers, a fun ride. This tale of Lycan Link and its top Enforcer, Reno Smith, and its top Damage Control Officer Brandi Johanssen, and their on-and-off relationship is designed to stand alone. Yet as prequel toThe Mating (Law of the Lycans)this bookBonded (Prequel to The Mating)provides a link to the other book by introducing Damien Masterson, who, with Kane Sinclair (hero ofThe Mating (Law of the Lycans)) and Ryne Taylor (Kane's half-brother and hero ofThe Keeping (Sequel to The Mating)) formed the Black Demons, three Lycans whose wolves are all black.In this story we learn more of the background of Lycan society in North America. We learn how packs can come to be dominated by Purists, the fundamentalists of Lycan society; and how Enforcers and Damage Control Officers function to keep Lycan life from the view of the general public. And, of course, there is the evolving relationship between Reno and Brandi.I heartily recommend this book to all readers of romantic novels. I also recommend that you read The Mating first, then The Keeping and then Bonded, as I did. It will give you a clearer understanding of the overall picture of the Lycan world.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I stumbled upon this author Never heard of her but WOW!!!! What a great author the characters are rich and full bodied and the story lines in all of the Law of the Lycans series is fantastic!! I couldn't believe they were FREE! ALERT the hostile characters are so rich that the villians make me so mad that I have to get up and walk away before I start yelling at them! LOL They are intense!! All of the individuals in the books want to make you either laugh, cry or scream (bad, bad ones) Order to read Bonded, Betrayed, The Mating, The Keeping, & tThe Finding!! I definetly Recommend!!!! Nicky Please write More!!!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Easy reading.  The series continues in several other books.  I have read 3 and the story lines are able to keep your interest.  The love scenes can be a little long.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Here is another great love and action stories written by Nicky Charles.  I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading.  As always Nicky writes with so much detail if you couldn't understand what she was telling you then it was her writing.  Great action and surely a great love story as well.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Reno is an enforcer, a bad ass..  Brandi has accidentally blood bonded to him. They both are to stubren to admit they love each other.  Beginning of a great series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Since this is a prequel to &#34;The Mating&#34; is explains some of the situations that occurred in that book. It adds history to the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This author is one of the best written with the least mistakes I have seen in e-books.  She also tells one heck of a story and keeps your interest from start to finish.  Well developed story and characters.  Great story to read.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Werewolves are a  great subject. . I read this prequel first. I enjoyed the characters and have all of the series so far. Good read.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I thought the basic plot of this book could have really taken off. However, the insecurities of Brandi and Reno got to the point of being downright annoying. &#34;Does he or she like me? Maybe, I should just forget about showing an interest in him or her. Gee, should I tell him or her how I really feel?&#34; Ugh! Midway through the book I wanted to smack them both upside the head!My advice to Nicky Charles is to stop dwelling on the insecurities of her characters. No one can be that insecure and it makes them totally unbelievable. Not to mention annoying since the book could have been much more interesting if she had taken their relationship in any number of possible directions.I'm now reading The Mating and it's not quit as bad. Nicky's writing style is different and creative and it's really too bad that she spends so much time having them wonder about feelings rather than putting her energy into developing interesting plot twists.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I read the Mating an it's series of three which I liked.  I found it hard to visualize a &#34;prequel&#34; but this book definitely hit the spot.  There are continuing treads which flesh out pack culture (sp?).,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is not your typical shifter romance. The story has a great plot, well developed characters who show personal growth during the course of the story, and addresses issues that are real and important. Thank you, Nicky....I haven't enjoyed a series this much in years!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,At first it took a short time to get into but once it did I couldn't put the book down until I was done. Now I have book 2 and look forward to reading it.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very action packed as well as several romantic ties. Easy reading I wanted to keep reading to find out what happens. I would definitely recommend this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I didn't want to put this book down.  If you like an adventure you will love this book.  Nicky captivated my imagination and didn't let me go (she still has me, you'll have to read the book to find out why).  The emotional roller coaster and I mean emotional that you experience is absolutely uncanny, something I loved in her story telling.  Once again she has captured me and pulled me into her story, until I can't wait to find out what is going to happen next.  Once again I enjoyed the characters, really believable.  It has just the right amount of sweet and sexy.... The right amount of angst and suspense.  A wonderful story.  Well done Nicky, well done.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Charles did a wonderful job with creating not just a story, but a new world to escape into. I can not believe my good fortune to have found this great read.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Long to say the least, but I couldn't put it down !!A lot of twists and turns with the two main characters! But definitely a have to read on book!!Usually I like more erotica but surprisingly this was satisfying !!!Thank you for the great read!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This story was redundant in character insecurities that it frustrated me. I enjoyed the suspense and concept of the story though.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,"When reading a lengthy series it isn't uncommon to have things start to fall apart 3 or 4 books in. Not the case with the Law of the Lycan series. Though this book is numbered 0.05, it is the fourth one published and is every bit as good as the first. [I've some how gotten out of order and read it third, but I think I'll live.]Reno and Brandi are a heart wrenching couple. If ever there was someone you wanted to kick and then scream, ""Come on, figure out their feelings already...and your own too, while your at it"" in their face these two are the ones. Both try hard to do right by the other and suffer for their efforts. But I also had to respect that mutual sacrificial attitude. It also just served to make the conclusion more moving, though it did feel just a tad rushed by the time it all finally came together. I liked that Reno was strong and sexy but also inherently flawed, both in his own estimation and as a character. He felt fragile despite his strength. You don't see that too often. Brandi was ever exasperated, but you could relate to her difficult position. I really liked Damien too and can't wait for the next one about him.I've noted a clear change in the wolves as the books progress. In book one the human and wolf were as one, with no noticeable difference in persona. By book two the wolves were exerting influence on their human counterparts, and here we find that the wolves are distinctly separate characters. They and their humans discuss problems, fight for control, and argue over decision. I'm undecided if this is an improvement or not. Be that as it may, I'm enjoying the series and intend to continue with it.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I laughed, cried,jumped up and down, closed the book only to pick it right back up. WOW, this lady can write.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I read all tree books that were recommended by a friend.  The Keep, The Finding, and Bonded.  Bonded  was my favorite, I was sorry the end this book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"The book just had too much information that was often redundant. The overall story was great, but it was really slowed down by page upon page explaining pack hierarchy, the Lycan Link, etc. I found myself skipping page after page just to get to the action...",2
B00BT0J8ZS,Quick read. Tad bit cheesy but cute for a pre teen book. Cute references and great job with the storyline.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,Amazing!!!!  I loved this book and can't wait to start the next one. The mix of action and romance is well balanced.  And the take on the wolf side was different. Overall I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the paranormal.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,two tribes come together in a prearranged marriage. she has to leave her pack to move with her alpha husband to his pack and then some strange things start to happen! i love it. made keep turning the pages couldn't stop reading until the book was done!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Nicky Charles presents things in a realistic way. The plot is well written and the flow is good. I recommend this book to everyone who likes were stories.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,Boring book. Didn't take long to figure that one out! Don't waste your hard earned money! Total disappointment! Had to give it the one star!,1
B00BT0J8ZS,I loved this book. Its about a werewolf and the challenges that take place when finding their soul mates. This book is fantastic and i can't wait to keep reading the rest in the next volume.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This book is part of a series and each is a different story.  I thought that would bug me because I really liked the characters and of course wanted to know what happened to them after each book.  Each book is a continuation from book to book with different characters coming to the forefront and others taking a smaller roll.  Nicky Charles does a great job making you care about these characters and I really looked forward to the ending of each book in this series.  Most of the time I just couldn't put them down. I really like this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Didnt really understand how this fit into the series. but it was an ok book to read....maybe one day i will read it again and figure it out.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,Love nicky charles series I am looking forward to reading the next book. Thanks for an entertaining and free kindle book. I love the romantic twist nicky puts in all of the books.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"First and foremost, this is the longest free book I have ever read. The book was well written, and entertaining. I will and is recommending this author to all my friends. Was wondering though with her talent why are all her books, that i have seen so far, is FREE!!!!hmmm, not complaining though :)",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I was blown away at how well the author went through the emotions of the characters. Thrilled excited sad it's ended n wished there were more to the story. I would so recommend this book to my friends n family they surely will love it as much as I did.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book was great! It had a little bit of everything and was edited perfectly! Even better that it was free. I love how the author mentioned that she loves to write and she wants reviews as payment. But if we needed to spend our money, to donate to an animal shelter. Theyre arent many people out there like her and it shows in her writing. It has a little bit of angst, action, drama, sex, and ends with a happy feeling no matter everything the characters go through.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I've been reading about werewolves for sometime now but this is the first time that Lycan history had been cleverly embedded into a story line and did not sound like a history lesson.A great read overall though the story dragged at times. Reno and Brandi can be so stubborn at times that you want to wring their necks just to make them see sense. And quite frankly that's part of the charm of the story.Rated M for Mature due to subject matter, violence and sexual content",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was the firs time I've read Nicky Charles. I liked the concept and the characters, there was enough to get me excited to see how the story was going to open up other avenues and evolve.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Excellent Addition to the Werewolf Genre The point of view is refreshing. The hero/heroine and plot are interesting and believable.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This is one of the best series I have ever read.  It was such a great story line.  I didn't know which one to start first so I decided by the date written and I read the mating first and then went to Nicky Charles web site and found I should have started with bonded.so I just finish bonded.  It is not the recommend order but I have enjoyed both of the books so much I just could not put it down. I will read in order now.  Well worth reading.  I highly recommend this series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I really had a good time reading  &#8220;Bonded  &#8221;.  It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author.  As a matter of fact I have read the whole series.  Please go out a either donate to your local animal shelter, or volunteer like me.  It is very rewarding to help these creatures who are in a shelter for no fault of there own.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I couldn't and didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to get started on the next book in the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Excellent writing, and believable stories. Thank you for giving this genre credibility.Reno and Brandi's on and off again tug of war drove me crazy! Loved it!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I absolutely Love this series.  The story is written so well you can imagine it to be true.Love, Laughter, just a very good read...",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"So intense and emotional I didn't want to put it down. I finally went to sleep around 1am, but started reading again at 6 am. I couldn't stop. I had to know what happened. Full review [...]",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I just loved this page turning book. I loved how the plot was just one thing after another and there were no slow breaks.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,Very exciting and suspenseful reading.  It draws you in and makes you want to keep reading until the end.  I would recommend this book for the more mature audiences.  Thanks for a great story!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I loved this book and I can't wait to read the next book. I fell in love with the characters :),5
B00BT0J8ZS,It was so exciting just to see how Brandi & Reno acted and denying how they felt for each other. Both stubborn and fun at the same time.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I like all the books by Nicky Charles. They will keep you entertained for hours. You will not be able to put any one of his books down!  Sonja8@live,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Gives information about the Lycan communities that will help you when reading other books. Loved it, but not shockers at end like all the other books",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Could not put this down.  Ready to start the next. Then to see see about the author. You are awesome Nicky Charles. I donate all the time.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I so enjoyed this book. I must admit I'm not drawn to the paranormal plots to quick, but gad  I decided to take a chance on this one. I enjoyed the story line but at times the author repeated some of the same details over and over. And the two love interest...well I think there could have been more interaction between them to give them some foundation for their relationship. I still enjoyed the great details on how they argued with their wolves, the way the conversation would go back and forth between the two. I believe readers of Nicky Charles must posses some patients in the unfolding of the story. I recommend this book, but not if your in a hurry! Enjoy",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"The author builds an interesting world where humans are unaware of the ""wolves"", an agency within the wolf government is tasked with the cover ups. The main characters are in denial about their feelings and it leads to lots of interesting arguments. No spoilers but if you want a nice romance with an action plot this is the book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved the story again another awesome book by Nicky Charles. Looking forward 2 her next book the keeping and an others I've missed.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,this is the first one i read and got hooked.  it was fantastic and again Nicky Charles is off the chain with the stories of these werewolves.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"If you are into werewolf/lycan stories, read this one. I've read several from this author and haven't been disappointed. This is well written with plenty to keep your interest.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,This one was harder to get into.  But once I did it kept me interested.  Looking forward toThe next one.,3
B00BT0J8ZS,This book is just as good as all the rest maybe even better.  Thank you for this series.  I really enjoyed this one the best.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I loved this book and all the others in the series.  It is free, and she asks only that you make a donation to a local animal shelter.  What a wonderful idea.  Excellent story. Hope there are more.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,From the very beginning I was hooked and couldn't wait to turn one page after another.  A very engaging &#34;fairy tale,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Okay, let me start by saying this book, in fact the whole series, was free. The author only asks that the reader consider making a donation to their local animal shelter or food bank, which is pretty awesome when you think about it. Now for the book, I had a little trouble with this one. I love werewolf books, and I enjoyed another book in this series a great deal. That being said, I was frustrated by this one. It had all the elements of a great story, strong characters, conflicts, a dastardly but unknown villain...but it just seemed too drawn out for me. It's just my personal preferences, but I like a bit more action to be going on and a bit less time speculating on past incidents and future possibilities. Overall, it was pretty good, but not my favourite. I will however be reading the rest of the series. I think there's great potential here.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,"I could not stop reading this book!, it had me so spell bound that I actually woke up with my face in my iPad!, Nicky Charles defiantly knows her wolf species as well as the male female species.  I kept wanting to smack both Brandi and Reno in the head because they just could not see each other, and I wanted there wolves to bite them both in the buts, WOOH!, got a little emotional there, you have got to read this book, and I am so Proud of Nicky for giving up her proceeds to animal shelters, YOU ROCK GIRL! (-:",5
B00BT0J8ZS,My first book by Ms Charles and I loved it!  Got all the other books in the series. Reno and Brandi's story will keep you reading and your stomach in knots. There is always something going on and new characters are fluidly introduced. Definitely a new author to add to my favorites list!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"While a fairly fast paced story, it wasn't a book I just had to read in one sitting. It did however, comfortably wait to be picked back up and delved into as leisure. More action in a rather militant way, with Lycans being both sides of a coin, those 'Purists' and those who are just looking for a way of life that won't get them noticed and enjoy being a community. I liked the whole effect, and look forward to the rest of the series with anticipation!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I am thrilled to have found this series.  Paranormal, romance and suspense all my favorites in one book. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved the storyline. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  I was not sure if I would like it. But had trouble putting  it down to recharge my kindle.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I could not read this book fast enough, couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Interesting new way to think about were's, and enough romance to really keep me wanting to see what would happen next! Glad I already have the next 3 books downloaded so I can just keep reading.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,It was so exciting seeing the sparks fly between Brandi and Reno.  What an ending!  But what will happen to Damien?,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have read the entire series so far, each book is different but they all fit together. It's like watching a tv series but you can pick it up and put it down when you want to.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is a story to be at the top of my list of favorite series type novels, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Truly enjoyed this book.  You are a talented writer and the characters were believable.  Many shifter stories are primarily sex with a thin storyline.  I was excited to find as much character development and plot details in your books.  Couldn't wait to read them all.  After reading the last I am hoping you write more.  Whether you continue this series or start a new one, I will look for you as an author.  Although your books were free, I would have happily paid for them.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,NICKY I want to thank you for your writings.  I just read this first book and loved loved loved it.  I can not wait to start book two.  It has been awhile since in read a really well written and expressive book.  You are very talented.  I will do as you wish and donated to a safe animal shelter.  You a gem worth its weight.  Hope your readers cherish the gift you just have them.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I decided to try this book not expecting much because it was free. I was pleasantly surprised and proceeded to order the entire series. I would have paid for all of them without hesitation. The author states it is her hobby. She should be making money for her work. It is excellent. Will look for more books by this author for sure.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was my first read of author Nicky Charles.  I overall liked this story.  I liked the strong hero, Reno, the rogue enforcer and heroine Brandi.  It had a good plot twist and the secondary characters were engaging.  Other than a few spelling and fact that I think author took for granted we as readers knew that these shifters could automatically put clothes on after the changed, I started understanding better.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,Great paranormal novel. I love how this author gives a ton of info so there's no questions. Better yet is how the author only wants donations made very noble.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This was an  awesome book.  I wasn't sure what to think of it at first, but I really enjoyed it.  The story line was unique and flowed well.  The main characters were well thought out and written well.  I loved the tension between Reno and Brandi.I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I can never get enough of the wolf paranormal romance books and this one didn't let me down. I can't wait to start on the next book!,5
B00BT0J8ZS,This was a great book.  My only complaint is that it seemed a little too long.  Love the idea that the author is offering the books for free and urging readers to donate an equal value to a local charity.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I can't wait to read more of these books!!The one way to describe this is addicting!! I hope there are more to this series soon.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is an awesome story. It has everything......romance, action, and intrigue. I highly recommend this book. It was hard to put down!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Characters were enjoyable and the story line was engaging. I would recommend this book for others to enjoy as well.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,I read every book in this series. All I can say is I am hooked and want MORE!!! I only hope you can continue these stories. I have always loved reading vampire and werewolves. I have now decided to put stories of werewolves tops!Trina Whitehead,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I've never heard of his author before but I was very surprised.  This was a free book and I'm often disappointed in the spelling and grammar of most of the free books that I've come across, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story and character development and of course the lack a spelling and grammatical errors. Great read!!!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This us a great story about werewolves and how they could maintain their hidden identities from humans. It is a story of love, friendship, and lust.  This is a must read!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Really enjoyed the series. It was free to read.  If you enjoy werewolves, you will like this series.  Be sure to read in order. There are 2 ways to read it: The Mating, The Keeping, The Finding, Bonded, and Betrayed.  OR  Bonded, Betrayed, The Mating, The Keeping, and  The Finding. Either way wll be cohesive to the storyline.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"So I'll be honest. I got these books about two months ago and I got about two pages in with this before I quit.  But I picked it up again at 2 am on the 29th of April and I did NOT stop until I was finished with the Finding at nearly 11 pm last night! Nicky Charles, you are a genius with Lycans.  I absolutely could not put the books down.  I had to know what happened to the characters.  I had to keep going.  She has a way with words and she makes you instantly connect with the characters and you're immediately intrigued with their fates.  I really loved Reno and Brandi, but the only frustrating thing for me in all of this series, is the miscommunication of feelings every single time.  Otherwise, I can't complain. I adore these books.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Many of the paranormal writing these days is SWEET, come on people, these are werewolves,  the are strong, fierce, and strongly pack oriented, and they mate for life.  Nicky Charles did a great job portraying a not so sweet side of werewolves, something more realistic, and true to life. He has also kindly and generously shared his creative writing talent with us for free. At Nicky's request, I will increase this month's donation to the animal shelter to include the cost of this book. Thanks Nicky, and keep up the great writing.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book is a bit long winded, however if you love Lycans  you will have no problems getting through this book.  It has a great story, with a great amount of twists and turns that you don't expect.  This book got me. I'm going on to the next book in the series!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"I usually don't like the Werewolf & vampire novels, but after reading Bonded I am hooked! I loved it so much that I downloaded the rest of the series and I can't stop reading them, LOL.Nicky Charles is a great writer that captures your interest and keeps you guessing from start to finish. I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves to read a good book!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This series just draws you in and doesn't let go! I couldn't stop reading it. This is an amazing author!!! I have fallen in love with the characters. The books are so well written. They are a must read, once u start reading u will not want to stop",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I started in sequence, I just finished Bonded.I read all the great reviews, I must admit I agree with them all, Nicky has a great grasp on the Lycan Lore.The characters are believable, the plot is solid.There is enough mystery, suspense, humor, and of course a huge amount of Lycan loving going on.I look forward to reading the rest of the series, in the order suggested.I recommend  from what I've read so far, that anyone who enjoys paranormal / fantasy should definitely read Nicky's books.She's a great author.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Thank you, Nicky Charles for your amazing talent. I enjoy the world you have created. Please keep writing these amazing stories.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Very Good story line with great characters. I really enjoyed this book. The ending left me speechless, I couldn't believe it.",4
B00BT0J8ZS,Another good one! A little sad about the ending. I Enjoy the series. I have one more. Thank-you. 2 words,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Never thought a zombie book would be so good. Read this book in two days, that's how good it was.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This book is the first in the series, and let me tell you, could not put it down.  I liked everything about it, especially that the character development was SO well done.  The book also takes place over several years, and you do not realize it until the end.  Meaning: you see the main characters meet, antagonize each other, and ...... then the end.  Loved that.  No rushing, no immediate &#34;I love you, you love me&#34; moments that do not make sense.Good book.  Read it.  Best in the series, and the remainder ain'd bad either!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I have only one problem with this series, that being there is no numbering of the books.  You don't to read them in order, but it sure would make life easier.  I don't know, maybe something in the title or first couple of pages would be nice. I know,I know, this is the only one that actually says it should be read first.  When I downloaded the books from amazon, they were not in any reading order. Drive me crazy.  Other than that, great read, excellent story line, definitely will read them all",4
B00BT0J8ZS,"It kept my attention from the first page to the last. I did have to read the last 12 chapters over not because they were boring , I just couldn't wait to see what happened. The only fault I found was a certain situation was never cleared up, well maybe the next book.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Can't wait to read the next book in the series!  Love the characters and storyline.  You can't find a better book for the price,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"Nicky Charles managed to do it again!  Once I started, I couldn't put this book down until I read the entire book.  If you are a fan of romance, you'll love the entire series!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,I have read all her books so far and this one is as great as the others.  I can't wait to read what comes next.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,This author has a great imagination! The plot is completely unique and the sensuality between the characters is off the charts! It's one of the best stories I've read! The ending is so climactic you can't wait to read the next story! And that has nothing to do with wanting to see how the awesome relationship between the main characters  evolves! They are steamingly hot together! (My spellcheck just told me that wasn't a real word so I just made it up myself) Anyways I got Bonded (prequel to The Mating) and The Mating for free on the free book list so these stories are definitely worth it! Even if I had to pay money for them this first one I know for sure was worth it! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,4
B00BT0J8ZS,hope theres more about Damien and what happens to his story as well as the other characters in this story. very enjoyable.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"This is an amazing story, well written, so much so, I could not put it down.  One of the best books I have read since the Scanguard series.The characters have strength, strong storyline, intrigue, self doubt, honesty, lust and eventually love.This is a must read, you wont be disappointed!Cant wait to read the rest of the series....",5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I enjoyed this book a great deal and look forward to reading more by Nicky Charles. The storyline was complex and well developed, and the characters were realistic and believable. Thanks for making it available for free on my Kindle!",4
B00BT0J8ZS,I've downloaded the complete series. And I will be following up on Mating as soon as I've slept a few hours.  I couldn't put this one down. Thanks for writing it and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,I enjoyed this book very much. I cooperating the back ground within the story made for a very intriguing story.,4
B00BT0J8ZS,"The author does it again with a great werewolf story. Her style of writing is great and the characters are wonderful. Again, some werewolf lore and some romance that makes it interesting.",5
B00BT0J8ZS,Loved it! Awesome read from a fantastic author.  Couldn't stop reading. Stayed up all night to finish it. Loved it,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I began with this volume, and am now well into the series and having such a good time! I've long been fascinated by werewolves, and am pleased that the genre has progressed from the ""Lon Chaney, Jr."" school of werewolf lore (oh, those old b/w films from the 1950s!) to the contemporary view and all that that entails. This book and its companion novels are worthwhile reading on several levels:1. Characters: superbly ""illustrated"" and sexy as all get-out2. Settings: beautifully described and believable3. Plots: intricate and hypnotizing4. Value: each book is free -- what more could anyone want as an incentive to give them a try?I am a fan of this author, and intend to purchase future titles as they are published. Keep 'em coming, Nicky ... keep 'em coming!",5
B00BT0J8ZS,This is an amazing series of books and they are all free. The author is really nice and lets us download all the books for free. Thanks so much.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"Fantasy set in mostly real life situations.  Use your imagination and read along to a satisfying ending.  Easy read.  Characters yo like and wish for a happy end for them.  Unexpected, but satisfying conclusion.",3
B00BT0J8ZS,I truly enjoyed this book. It was action packed with intrigue and just the right amount of erotica and love. I can't wait to start the next book of this series. A pretty good read for the avid reader.,5
B00BT0J8ZS,"I loved this story, it had the perfect combination of action, suspense and romance mixed with a little sex. What more can you ask for?",4
B00BTIDW4S,I really love how this author weaves a story.  This book is not as great as the prequel but still really good.  I kind of miss the dialogue that the first book had with the main character and the inner wolf.  Overall great read.  Happy reading.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I am totally addicted to the series. It has all this twist and turns. You know who the evil character are but the end as always has something to keep you interested. I was on the edge of my seat. Honestly I had to stop what I was doing because I wanted to know what was next. Moving on yo the next book in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love all sorts of romance novels. I have been hooked on wolves lately and only found a few of those short erotica ones but that was definitely not what I wanted. I don't mind the steam but I would much prefer a story behind the nymphs. This had a great story line and steam for sure. Great read and a long novel which made nicky my favorite author of the week.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Love this series!! They're very addicting.i do recommend this series to everyone who loves to read the paranormal shifter stories.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I don't understand the reviews saying it's an about rape...there is none. There were situations where both parties were forced but that's about it.The story gave depth to each character as they are presented throughout the story. Even the villain has a good story. The romance was great but so were the action ans suspense scenes. There was so much suspense it made me nervous and the author did a great job letting it build until the end. Its like you can see it, you know what is going to happen and you have to keep reading to see how it will all play out. Exhilarating...read it.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is a great read for werewolf fans. I would get frustrated but could not walk away. Very exciting book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,What a fantastic book!  Truly amazing and I could not put it down.  So well written and the excitement throughout kept me from putting my iPad down until I finished it.  Outstanding!!!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"My my my! I love this book! Was hooked from beginning to the end. My sister read this before I did and told me I have to read it, it is a really good book and I must admit it really is! I don't like to ruin things for people so all I will say is Marla is aB@$&+!!!!!!  The love making amongst other things that were said and done. Don't recommend this for the young but for the adults it is a must read!  Well written and looking forward to the rest of the series! If we all could have the love and desire that is in this..my oh my!!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles is a wonderful writer, she has taken a theme, were-wolves, that has been wrote to death, and given it new life.  Thank you so much!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Initially I thought this was just going to be another alpha-claims-a-mate story, and Don't get me wrong he did but there was so much more.  A intriguing detailed story, well developed characters, some steamy sex, and humor too.  I would like to see a follow-up.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is either the first, second, or third book in this series depending on how you read them.  I do recommend reading them all, and I read this one second.  The story and characters were fun and entertaining.  I would get all of them and read straight through.  A very enjoyable series",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I just keep repeating my self, evey book I read by Nicky is very good and keeps me reading write more Nicky!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The story flowed as if I was there. Excellent characters, made for a very good read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Very nice, I really enjoyed it. I liked the strength of the characters and especially Elise's loyalty, to her mate and her friendship to Bryan.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I love any paranormal type book, and this one was fantastic. I'm now beginning to love werewolves more than vampires thanks to this phenomenal story! Hope to read more.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I think this was a typical classic romance, but with a new twist. It turned out to be a good book, that left me wanting more!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,predictable. boring. main charachter not that bright. did not like the style of switching present to past back to present. cannot believe its overall star rating. dont waste your time,2
B00BTIDW4S,What a great book!  Love the character of Marla as the villain in this story....just couldn't stop reading this book!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Great book.  Really could not put it down, until it was finished  can't wait to read the rest of the series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I couldn't put this book down. I loved the emotions of the pack members and wanted to be there too.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I think her books are great. Loved the stories and the mystery in each one. Would loved to read Forever In Time but can't find it on my Kindle.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is the third book I've read in the series. I loved them all and even though this particular book is pretty predictable, it was an amazing addition to the series. Loved it!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"There are SO many sharpeshifer books out there - most of them I have read.....I am always looking for another good writer. This book didn't cut it. Forced sex, no romance, no communication between the couple neither of whom are in anyway original, and an obvious cartoon of a bad guy. While I think it is terrific Nicky wants donations to go towards animal shelters,I can't in good faith support what I consider to be a mediocre book.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"&#34;Sometimes our lives have moments of great disappointment. It's difficult at the time, but we have to move beyond.&#34;There are few books that keep me reading until the wee hours of the night. The Mating was one of them. From the very first page I could not put the book down and when I had too I was anxious to get back to it.Ending up mated to a complete stranger was never something Elise thought of. She always thought that one day she would marry someone in her tribe that she was in love with. That man was Brandon. But when she returns home from an outing with Brandon Elise is introduced to her new mate, Kane. Because Kane has just become an Alpha and Elise&#8217;s tribe needs an ally they are &#8220;mated&#8221; on the same night of their first encounter. And to seal the deal the two must consummate their &#8220;marriage&#8221; which is something Elise has always thought would be with someone she loves.What surprises her though is the tenderness that Kane shows her and the feelings that ignite in her when they are together.When she finally arrives at her new home Elise quickly becomes the target of someone's revenge. While her new pack tries to stay alive and keep away the killer, Elise tries to come to terms with her new home and her new mate. Kane is a great mate but he also doesn't see what's so obvious to everyone else. The girl he has grown up with also has her sights set on him. And she won't let go so easily.The Mating is a wonderful concoction of romance and suspense, with a side of HOT Alpha male. While the book weaves in a wonderful suspenseful mix, its focus is Elise and Kane's mating and the growth of their relationship. Elise was a wonderful headstrong heroine and Kane was a sweet but intense Alpha. There were some pretty HOT scenes which will have you devouring the pages, but it wasn't overly done.Thank you to the lovely reader who recommended this series because I adored it!! But don't take my word for it, Pick it up. Read it. Adore it!Happy Reading!",4
B00BTIDW4S,Can't believe this was a free book getting ready to read the sequel now. Lots of twist and turns. Didn't think it would be interesting but it kept me highly entertained this author was really good. Was so happy for the couple hope to read more about then and maybe some little ones,5
B00BTIDW4S,Characters and story line are okay but nothing spectacular. Easy read. Going to check out the other books since they're free.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Could not put this book down! Loved from beginning to end! Had the right amount action, love and mystery. Would recommend it to anyone in to werewolves or a good read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Couldn't stop reading this series.  I read all four, still waiting for the 5th to come out.This had everything, eroctic, laughter, crying and excitement.  Nicky Charles did great on this series Law of the Lyrcans.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Definitely recommend this book. It has love, mystery, and betrayal. I liked how the author developed the relationship between Elise and Kane. Plot was great. I look forward to reading more from this author.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Enjoyable read about werewolves. This is your typical alpha male that takes a mate, but there are best little twists and turns. I did get a little aggravated with the internal monologue a couple of times in the book, but whatever. It was still a good read.Read again: Maybe, but probably notRecommend: for Alpha loving readers, yep!Heat: 3.5/5",4
B00BTIDW4S,Gave this book a try at first reading the intro I was not caught and took time reading it......but when I started I became immersed and glad I did.......very well written captures the reader and you really enjoy the main characters........I shall be a fan of this writer......good storyline......,5
B00BTIDW4S,Good book with great detail of the Lycan story. Kane story is slow to start but keeps you hanging until the end.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Great story! Difficult to put down. ~ this paranormal romance story captivated my interest.  Book was full of suspense and unpredictable events.  You can receive this e -book free through Amazon.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I am not really sure if I liked this book. I can't say that I didn't like it, but I can't say that I liked it either. I can say that it was okay. I think that the one thing that I didn't like about this book was the fact that there was almost no thoughts from Kane. I mean there was maybe one tiny section towards the end of the book, but that was it. All throughout reading this I wanted to know what Kane thought. I mean did he really want to mate with Elise, what did he really think about the string of incidents that were going on with his pack. Every major event, we never got anything from Kane's perspective. I think that if there was more from Kane's perspective, then I could say conclusively whether or not I liked this book. Also there was very little dialogue. There was too much exposition from Elise, it made the story drag. If there was more than one perspective on events then I think that the story would have move more quickly. But it was a struggle to get through this book for me.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I couldn't put this book now, read for hours on end sometime not realizing it was time to get up and go to work..LOVE IT!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to keep up with the excitement. It's a real page turner. I'm looking forward to see what happens in the next book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed Kane and Elise's story.. Even the far-fetched parts! But two things REALLY bothered me: the discussion about remembering to &#34;magick&#34; your clothes back on and the near-rape/blood bonding of the new mates. Other than that, I enjoyed it. I will be looking into more Nicky Charles' books.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed the story very much. I cheered Elise on all the way.  There were minor mishaps in the writing, but a great story none the less.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"If you are continuing in the Law of the Lycans series, you will find this another great write from the author!  I don't know how she manages to do every book so great, but she did it again!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"If you like fantasy love and suspense stories this is it.  It has elements of real wolf behavior (pack mentality) alphas and betas.  Murder, theft and jealousy are all there.  The book moves fast!!  Can not wait to read The Keeping!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have never read a book from this author before,it had everything I usually look for...my only complaint is I thought Elise was to passive,but other than that it was really fun and found myself staying up late to finish it ,I am looking forward to reading more books from this author.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I know that this was a free book but I'm so glad I got it. It was a really good wolf book. I really liked the characters and I'm looking forward to reading the next book. I liked the way the author brought the characters to life and the description of the back drop for the area they lived in. I could smell the forest and the cooking Helen was doing. Yes I do recommend this book. Now on to the next book!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved the story. It was charming. But that being said the word 'realize' was spelled 'realise' throughout most of the book. As a matter of fact any word with a 'z' was spelled with an 's'. Agonize, apologize. All spelled wrong. I think 'realize was spelled correctly maybe five times in the whole book which is saying something because the author used the word at least every other page. A few other spellings were wrong as well. I thought maybe it was a British spelling because I've seen it that way with other authors who are British or are just trying to use British spelling such as 'colour'. But since it was spelled correctly a few times I doubt that is the case. A bit more editing and this book could be something incredible. I gave only three stars because of the spelling. But the story was great, a page turner for me! Beautiful love story, well written and tasteful sex scenes. I would recommend it for anyone who isn't going to give up on it simply because words are misspelled. I definitely didn't trip through the errors or anything. Most people may not even notice. Hope to read more from Nicky Charles!",3
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book. I have the next in the series on my to be read list. I loved everything about this storyline.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love Elise and how strong she was.  But Kane and his brother Ryne seem like they are gorgeous!  This story had my imagination going when it came to picturing them.  But I like the closeness and the importance of how family and friends stuck together.  This is very important.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I'm not a genre reader . . . I like to try every angle of fiction and had expected this to be love canine style, but it was a really good book.  And not as a canine love story but as a real honest to goodness love story of folks who just happened to be werewolves.  I was quite surprised by the quality of the story as a lot of these off-the-track genre books are basically a fetish wrapped in sub-standard story telling.  This was not the case for this book.  I enjoyed the writing style and enjoyed the story telling ability of the author.  Enjoyable read!",4
B00BTIDW4S,I never thought I would find another series that would give me the thrill of Twilight but here it is. Every page of this story took me further into the fantasy world of werewolves and I couldn't put the book down. I held my breathe when there seemed to be danger and how the characters were caught up in these situations. I had to continue reading to see how it would end. I am so glad I downloaded the entire series because one book is not enough.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I read this book and was happy with the length and the time it took. Kept me interested, characters were easy to love and be involved with. A great read if your wanting a good werewolf romance book.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really loved the first book in this series, but the others are so much alike that you could skip the other books in this series.  Same story, almost, but with different people.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I started with this book because it was free. It is a good story introducing two strangers that have to work together to make a future together. I ended up buying the rest of the series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the entire series.  Nicky Charles makes her work easily accessible and enjoyable to read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I thought this book was great! Yes there are stereotypes of what comes with a supernatural romance, but it was well written and the characters were well thought out. I am very excited for the next one! I can't Wait",4
B00BTIDW4S,It is steamy and erotic!  I love this author! I am going to read all the Law of the Lycan books.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I usually don't read the free books but this was amazing! Immediately I wondered why on earth they would be free.  I read the mating in one day and loved it. I will definitely continue with teh rest of the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I was so confused about how I felt about Kane in this book. Sometimes he could be a major jerk. And sometimes you could figure out what some of the little events were going to lead to (like Marla talking Elise into hiding something) but the ending had an unexpected twist (for me anyway) and Elise was a very strong girl, emotionally and physically. I really enjoyed her character.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Loved it! Very simple, can tell its froma new author with lots of promise. Can't wait to read more from her.",4
B00BTIDW4S,loved nicky charles books. they are a little long but well worth the read. Thanks for the great story line.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles continues to not disappoint in these series of books. Would have given 5 stars but the female main character Elise was a lot weaker than the other women in the previous books. I would have liked to her not to have been so naive. But, this was still a fantastic book!!",4
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles imagination and characters flowed wonderfully through the pages. If you are a shape-shifter romantic this is something for you. Loved the Alpha and his brother. Wouldn't mind having one of my own in my pocket. Good job!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles is my new favorite author. I love these books. In thanks as per the authors wishes I donated 50 dollars to the ""Better off Fed"" kitten rescue found on Facebook. They rescue kittens from death row in North Carolina. Thanks to Ms Charles some fur babies will have a life. Really I cannot tell you how wonderful these books are, try them, you'll love them!!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky your books are new to me but now I am a fan. Good writing and story. Thanks so much.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Really enjoyed this one.  Was miffed at first bc it didn't seem fair that Elise had to leave her pack and her ""friend"" Brian. Things definitely get jumbled up in the story but it will keep you wanting way more, it did me! Now  gotta find out more about Ryne. Has unexpected twists and turns, and lots of maybe's and what if's.",4
B00BTIDW4S,There was so many good reviews I over looked the bad but half way through I wish I paid closer attention to those bad reviews. The book started off pretty promising but by the middle I wanted to slap Elisa. She and the whole group of characters was annoying.Read at your own risk.,2
B00BTIDW4S,"The writing was not what I was expecting. I was hoping it would be better...much, much better. Alas, I was disappointed.",1
B00BTIDW4S,This book brought up a old custom and put a spin and twist on it I loved it brings to mind similar books by Lynsay Sands but with werewolves vs vampires.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"THIS BOOK HAS THE ELEMENTS OF A GOOD BOOK,INTRIGUE,MYSTERY,LOVE,AND WEREWOLVES.YOU WILL KNOW WHO THE VILLAIN IS AS SOON AS THEY'RE INTRODUCED.ELISE THE MAIN CHARACTER FIGURED IT OUT,BUT THE ALPHA AND THE PACK DIDN'T.I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE ALPHA(KANE)SO SMART IN MOST THINGS ,DIDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book is a great read! Easy to identify with the characters and story line. Enjoyable story, mystery, humor, romance, and will make you remember what it felt like to fall in love.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book surprised me, great story line that drew you in to their world. The drama unfolding with the love growing between the main characters, while suffering acts of sabotage was a good twist.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This book went above and beyond what i expected. I was pleasantly surprised with the story line it made me say wow out loud a few times. I cant wait to dive into the next one,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a awesome book to read, especially if you are into werewolves but even if you're not, you love the story with the different twist and plots; you will also fall in love with Kane, Elise and Ryan. This is the first book in a series. It is really worth reading.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is a good read although I'm still only about 34% of the way through. I'm a little confused at this point but I'm sure I will figure it all out by the end. I'm looking forward to reading the next books in the series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,This is easily one of my favorite of the series. Love the characters love the Lycan world. I suggest getting this book for sure if you read any of these books in the series. You don't have to read any of the prequels if you want to just read one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is THE book that got me into paranormal romance, especially werewolves.  Once I read this book, I read the rest of the series and loved every one.  Plus they are all free and you can't beat that!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is the first free book from Amazon that was actually worth reading! I had a hard time putting it down. I really enjoyed this and look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This union reminds me of my grandparents. You were married young before you knew either one. You grew to love one another and to learn about one another.  Unlike today where we live together first, have sex  before marriage. I wish it could be that way again. So simple.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a very good book. I enjoyed getting to know the characters. Once I finished it I couldn't wait to begin the next one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was recommended by a friend. Started off not sure how i would feel about this, but it didnt take long before i was HOOKED! Oh the alpha males - Kane - a strong leader who has a protective side for his mate. Can i have him? Cant wait to read the others!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Considering I'm not into werewolves or vampires. Would recommend to all readers. Keep an open mind and you're sure to enjoy this book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Though a flashy book cover does generally tend to draw a perspective reader to check out the synopsis of the story, I'm really glad that I didn't allow the lack of flash to deter me from checking out the synopsis. I really enjoyed the story, it had the perfect balance of action and romance in my opinion, as well as the down time and moments of frustration.I really enjoyed how the author added realistic misunderstandings between Elise and Kane. It never came across as fake or something that should have been obvious. Granted you as the reader knows what is going on, but taking it from the characters perspectives, as I said, the misunderstandings are very realistic and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I really hope the author has a 'book two' in mind. I would love to see where the story goes with the this book ended. I would highly recommend this book to others.Amanda SpantonAuthor of Finding Arianna",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Very enjoyable story line,  keeps you interested enough to look for the other stories. Nicky Charles is a very good writer.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good book! I love books where mating press before wolves and love happens. I hope there is a book number two so we can read about the new pack and maybe everyone else falling in love and mating.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Well written stories about love, sex, attachment fears and relationships. A really good read! I look forward to the next book in the series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,You never know how much you will like a book until you read it. I think it's an awesome addition to the supernatural world of books. I'm starting the next one soon. Thanks for letting me read it for free.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Started out almost not liking the main character (Elise) but it just made me love her that much more when she showed her strength of character and courage in facing a new life and new mate. Absolutely loved this whole series and highly recommend them to anyone. Got wrapped in and couldn't put down the books until the entire series was completely finished and am already missing the characters that I've grown to know and love. ;),5
B00BTIDW4S,Would gladly had paid for this book. Great characters and plot . The action packed adventure is well written and the author is phenomenal and unexpected twists to the story line are intriguing.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Definitely lived up to expectations I like the way the characters interact and continue from one book to the next. I like the story better than the graphic sex.Just my opinion. I guess others would disagree I will keep reading the series and appreciating that it is free!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Every month I look through to see if there has been any new books about vampire or werewolf romance and most are good but very short, I have read everyone of Nickie Charles' book except the last one, and trust me....... I think I will still want more after this last book, kind of want to here Daniel's story.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I didn't like it both main characters were clueless and I just kept getting bored.  I don't really have much to say.  Unfortunately I bought both books in series at same time.  Never do that again!,2
B00BTIDW4S,I just like the book it was great i would tell others to read it thank you keep up good work,5
B00BTIDW4S,It is hard to get interested in the marriage of an 18 year old.  Yeah it's creepy that in a modern age a teenager is forced into marriage. But otherwise she is too young to be an intersting character in an adult series.  She is extremely naive and has no real personality yet.  The author should let this character age a little instead of inflicting this child bride on us.  Also the lack of the hero's point of view assured we didn't get to know his presumably more interesting character either.  After reading Bonded I was excited to get to know this member of the Black Devils.  But unlike Bonded where you got to know both Damien and Reno's personalities this book leaves its hero largely a stranger.,2
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a great book! Really you want to read Bonded first just to get a little understanding first but BOTH ARE FREE and its NOT needed.I want to thank the author Ms. Charles for making this AWESOME series free.Yes i said that the entire series is free.an easy way to find the free downloads(with the free instructions on how to download)is at the end of ALL her books there is a link to her site and then you pick the book and go to a site that allows for free downloads.I was going to pay for all the series but then after reading other peoples' reviews ...and Ms.Charles remarks found them easily for free.No they are not pirated copies...as per Ms.Charles.I read ""Bonded"" and was hooked last night i couldnt put down ""The Mating"" I had to stop myself there.Plz be aware that Ms. Charles has requested that if you like her books ...""pay her""by writting a review:) OR by buying a bag of food for your local animal shelter.:)PLZ dont judge a book (or series) by the price you pay.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I could not put this book down. I immediately picked up the other two on my kindle. I am now looking for books by this author. She is awesome. If you love paranormal download this book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is actually the second time I've t read this book and it was just as good the second time as the first!! This series is one of the first series I read when I got my first cheap e-reader and I can't say enough good things about these books. The characters are strong and likeable the plots are somewhat predictable, but still they are all must reads",5
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating by Nicky Charles is my favourite book of all time! The characters and plot and progression of the unfolding mysteries are wonderfully written, you have got to read this book, you won't regret it!!! Seriously best book EVER!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Im fan of supernatural beings. This book was very well done. I love the characters and story kine. I could picture this as a movie.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This was the first shapeshifter romance I ever read and loved it.  Elise and Kane are such a cute couple.  I love Alpha males and Kane was no exception.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I would highly recommend this entire series to anyone who enjoys reading books about werewolves. I would also recommend reading Bonded - the prequel to this book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"If you were fortunate enough to get this book for free you are doubly blessed; saving money but also, more importantly, being introduced to a terrific author.  Not only have I read this book, but I've read the series to date, as well as other titles by this author.  I cannot express my pleasure at reading an entertaining story, well plotted, with wonderfully drawn characters, and most of all NONE of the amateur spelling and grammar errors so often found in &#34;freebies&#34;.  I am re- reading this series (something I never do), and BUYING the latest release.  If you have never read this series...join me, you won't be disappointed.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Elise, a sheltered youngest daughter of the pack Alpha and Kane the Alpha of the neighboring were pack are wed in an arranged marriage. Now they must overcome the difficulties of being strangers to discover an underlying love. A modern romance with a werewolf twist that I truly enjoyed.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I really like Nicky Charles' books!  I like the erotic aspect of the book, the characters, and the fact that when they change to werewolves it wasn't a 'gruesome' thing but just a different aspect of their personality.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This genre is getting run into the ground. This isn't any different than Twilight, just not written as well.  I really did not enjoy the premise, the writing was alright, but there was nothing original about this genre to compel me to finish it.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"Good book, had a bit of everything! I would imagine pre-arranged marriages were like this only this seemed to have great sex from the beginning, which is true fiction.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this book. It felt like I was reading a good episode of a soap opera. N I don't watch them. Lol if you need a good beach ride or a day at the park relaxing u should read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Absolutely loved this book!!! Starting on the next one right now. Excellent character development and the plot was great!  I can't believe all these books are free...of course I'm not complaining. I have every book available that was written by Nicky Charles and hope that they keep on coming.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is the 3rd Nicky Charles book I've read and I'm in to the 4th!!!  They are excellent. Although, the number of typos is high, the story line and descriptions are so good it makes up for it.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I want to know what happens with Ry the brother!!!!it is torture : ) I really liked the book but it left  not  said about pups  and the brother,usually at the end of a book of there's follow ups they list them but I didn't see any I would buy even If I got this one for free",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is my second time reading through the series. Love it!!  Keep up the good work. I was wondering If there would be more after the last book? Maybe bring some of the lesser characters to light so that we know more about Ryne's pack and how he goes about expanding it. Also it would be nice to read Bryan's complete story. There's so many that I would love to list but I'm trying not to overwhelm you or myself lol. Also some of the original pack members stories would be nice.I've recommended your books to a lot of people and when their done they'll call and say you were right,this is a great series.Thanks so much for the hard work you've put into these. Looking forward to more from you on both packs (hopefully).Again great work!!Amy B",5
B00BTIDW4S,"With a combination of mystery,action,love & of course some Spicy werewolves this book really kept me guessing! I just had to know what was gonna happen next....retreat read",5
B00BTIDW4S,Elise is the youngest daughter of the Alpha and she thinks she is in love.  She didn't know that her Alpha father would promise her to another Akpha for political purposes.Kane is the new Alpha to his pack and is doing everything he can to just hang on.This is such a great story. Twist & turns all around the budding relationship of Elise & Kane!5 of 5 all the way!,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book is awesome I loved it it is a very good book you will in joy the hot sex!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I cant believe this book is on the free Kindle Book page. I did not put my Kindle down for 3 days. This book needs a sequel.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was quite surprisingly, a really good story... my opinion in no way an insult to the author;  I am no fan of the supernatural or paranormal & intentionally avoid reading material with said content.  When I started reading this book, I was turned off because it involved werewolves.  But, as I continued to read page after page, I got hooked!!!  This has a little bit of everything, including drama, suspense and romance wrapped in tradition & erotica... you will like the characters of Elise & Kane and will root for their success... a truly powerful & enjoyable read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I couldn't put this book down. It was very well written. I can't wait to read the rest in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good love story. Kept you wanting to read to make sure the vilan got wat they deserved. Good book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I wasn't sure at first but it got such good ratings. Loved this book but I do wish ryne was in it more. Hopefully a sequel???  Lol anyway. I liked this book I knew Marla was a bitch but I never figured she would be so crazy. Anyway loved the book, would totally recommend.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Give this series a try, even if you don't usually read romance novels. A new take on the werewolf genre and a very good read",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Awesome series! Story line and characters were very well done. They had it all, romance, suspense, comedy and a healthy dose of sex! Thank you for making them all free! I would have gladly paid for them.  I will be keeping an eye on sequels to come.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Finding this for free I thought it wouldn't be one of my favorites. Yet I am reading book 4 in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved all these books in this series, couldn't put it down. Nicky Charles gets you hooked:) I love that you still go back to characters from the past books in this series. Great read everyone, you will not be disapointed.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Wow! I have found another author that just makes me love too read! I can say Nicky Charles is now one of my favorite author's! This lady knows how to write an incredible story!!!! I LOVE this book and look forward to reading all her other novels!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this story! Kane was an awesome mate. He was hot on so many levels. The only drawback for Me was how naive that Elise was. She knew Marla wanted her man and yet she continued to give her the benefit of the doubt. Elise saw a few things going on that made her think something wasn't right, and she dismissed it. She would listen to Marla, who had did nothing but lie to vet closer to Kane. Why would you listen to her? That was a little frustrating because you knew something bad was going to happen, but Elise didn't see it. But I really loved how the relationship between Kane and Elise blossomed. One of my faves was where Elise is in heat, Kane and her are arguing, leading to a very hot scene that included a blood bond. I loved how it came about, a totally fresh approach. This was a very good story and I am looking forward to reading more from this author.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Elise and Kane met and married in the same day so they started out different than other mated couples. This was a good book that had a lot of drama and suspense.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I'm not usually into wolf story's but this was worth my time. I liked it more than the pre book. I'm off to read the next!,4
B00BTIDW4S,This book was awesome. Has great character's and story lines. For those that love the Lycan stories this one is great but with a different spin on the tale. I enjoyed it immensely..,5
B00BTIDW4S,The book is good. It does have a good story that start with a marriage. Yet a lot of stuff happening in the book that makes the book loose it's charm with the reader's. Good story line yet not quite polished.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"Hmmmm, reminds a bit of the Twilight series where the baddies are the goodies and werewolves are not what they are normally purported to be.  I do like the plot though and I think the author put some effort into the story.",3
B00BTIDW4S,Good read characters were believable yet after reading so many similar stories I knew where the book was going. It is neat how the author put the animal nature of wolves within the book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I read the first book by mistake. Was hooked on the story line. Interesting use of paranormal circumstances in which one can become involved, even knowing that it is fiction. I will be reading the sequel. Never thought I would read this genre of fiction",5
B00BTIDW4S,I read this series about a year a r ago and really enjoyed it so I d ed corrective it again. I am glad I did! Great book!,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book was great I could not put it down. if you love a good suspense/romance book this is the book for you.,4
B00BTIDW4S,This is a great story it is the first book I have read in a long time that I related to the main female character.  The way she did what was expected from her and made the best out of situations.  The fact that no matter how she tried to do what was best she always ended up trying to explain it to the one that meant the most along with trying to sort out her feelings along the way.  I related so much to the character that I had tension running through my shoulders every time I knew something was going to backfire on her.  It has been a while since a book has let me relate that deeply and understand what she was going through I can't wait to read the rest of the series even if I did start in the middle what a writer it's just fantastic and realistic thanks so much!,5
B00BTIDW4S,The first book was fantastic. The second book was just as awesome. I'm going to have to read the rest of the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I find it hard to relate how ignorant of sex and relationships elise is. Sje remind s me of elsie the cow getting sold by her dad and then humped by kane the cowpoke. ha ha But really the junior high school dialogue can wear on you. Half way through the book elise makes a list to figure out how bad her antagonist is milking and raping her and still cant connest the dots. Of course its the boys old bitch ho. It was more than obvious before she wrote down the facts. At least no one can accuse elise of independant thought. She should wind up very codependant with kane and live in a kennel forever with him. Yeah I would bang the brother just to keep him jealous as well. LOL I like the book and will try to see Nickys maturation in her progressions. Thanks for the freebee. Peace out.,3
B00BTIDW4S,I was so disappointed when I had to stop reading for a while. It was two in the morning so I needed to go to bed.  As soon as I got up I had to resume the book until it was finished. The book was a little predictable but I was still entranced.  I loved the character of Elise. She was so real and I felt every emotion with her. I even cried a little. The love scenes were erotic without being too raunchy. Perfect blend! I've downloaded the sequel and can't wait to get to it!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this book, but I do think the title needs to be changed.  When I read the first chapter I was thinking I probably was not going to enjoy this book, but by the second & third chapters I found it to be like a soap opera and I was hanging on every word just dying to find out when everyone would realize the truth of what was happening within the pack.  This is a werewolf novel, but the whole werewolf thing is kind of secondary to the story.  This is a love story mixed in with suspenseful drama.  There is enough romance to get you excited, but not so much that you're like ""really?...this again?"".  Too much is too much, but this wasn't too much.  I disagree with those who claim there is rape in this book...it was a case of the ""wife"" being angry and not wanting to want to have relations, but couldn't help the fact that she did want IT...and the ""husband"" felt the same during the same situation...they were angry with each other, but still wanted each other (if you know what I mean) while at the same time didn't want to WANT each other because they were angry...I hope that's not too confusing.  I can see how a sensitive person could view that particular scene as a rape scene, but it wasn't.  I read this book in 3 days which is super-fast for me.  If you like paranormal romance, I think you'll enjoy this book.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"liked this book. kept me interested. kinda predictable, but I was still into it.  Im excited to read the next one.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Very well written (aside from typos here and there that you can easily look over).I got this book without reading the summary (impulsive!) And read it in one sitting. The drama is fantastic and the way Marla was portrayed was great! You could really feel the same thoughts as Elise while reading this book.I highly recommend it.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a great book. It kept me interested and I really couldn't put it down. I'm excited to start the next.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Loved it! I felt as if I were there in real live, witnessing the verbal and silent exchanges between each character. I'd definitely wouldn't regret spending a little money of this story.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book just pissed me off. Elise is such a weak character who lets people walk all over her and manipulate her. It is obvious what Marla's plans are, yet Elise who is supposed to be the Alpha's mate is too oblivious to life around her to realize anything. I'm not a fan of predictable books, and this one was just so predictable that when the characters didn't even catch on it was time to delete this book. Don't waste your time because you know how the book is going to end before you even read half the book.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved the story of opposites attract.I enjoied the detailed scenery, it made me want to go hike out in the mountains.The author showed how a story of this genre can keep its tradition with &#34;primal Alpha ways&#34;,And yet modernizing it with &#34; environmental issues &#34; and lots of money.I look forward to the next installment, and I've shared this with friends to read right away!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Can we say RAPE-Y!!!  There is no disguising that this was not romance, it was rape!  All the five star reviews are really disturbing!",1
B00BTIDW4S,"First off I enjoyed this book!  This turns into a sweet love story.  You go from the bummed and troubled to sacrifice and loves.  I would read more, intact I have downloaded the next",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I downloaded most of this author's books because they were free and I was intrigued that it was generally given a good rating.  I am enjoying the books but this is the second time that the characters although likeable seem stupid in their failure to understand each other.  Normally this could work well but there is something missing in the way the characters are developed that stops the book from going further, at least that is my opinion and I am only one person.  I am disappointed that the author doesn't go that extra mile because she certainly has ability and the plot has potential and has characters cleverly introduced to give options to other books.  It's free and a good read, it's worth a try.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I have read three books in this series out of order.  Each book has added more depth to the total of the story on how a pack of wolves would work together for survival.  I enjoyed  how each romance developed and how it affected the entire pack.  I found my mind wandering at times reading this book.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"Better than I thought, the story grabs you right away and takes off.  There was some slower parts I felt towards the end but overall great!",4
B00BTIDW4S,This is the second time I have read this and I still love it. I really liked the story line though for me there was a little tmi in the sex part. Maybe because there are only so many ways to describe it without  reaching a point where it is predictable and repetitious and worthy of being skimmed through. Not that Ms. Charles isn' t skilled at writing them: maybe I have just read too of many such scenes. I can't believe the books are free. Thanks and keep it up. I love the world you created.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I was browsing the free books to find something to read. Found the The Mating, downloaded it and started reading. I couldn't put my kindle down! Great Book!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was amazing ! The Mating is about Kane and Elise, although in the beginning there is no Love at the end everything changes.I just could not stop reading .This book kept me on edge, made me cry,laugh! The author Nicky Charles knows how to capture his audience with all his books.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Lycans and all this book was good. From formal alliance 'marriage' to the plotting and tricks that happened. Who would of guessed things would of turned out like this just for an arranged bonding. Amazing story and plot. I would recommend it.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"With all the books I've read so far by Nicky Charles and the Law of the Lycans set I was just there with them. They all pulled me in and I couldn't put them down. Just getting to know each person and hear their stories and see their lives and how they continue on with the other parts of the family and then the end with Cassie and her story, I was blown away. I can't say enought about The Mating, The Keeping, The Finding, The Bonding and I can't wait to read Betrayed: Days of the Rogue. I'm pretty sure I know who it's going to be about and I'm dying to know what he's been up to. Love them all and can't say enough good about them and how they flow with eachother!!! It's nice to find a group of paranormal other than vamps that I truly enjoy reading about and becoming part of the story and I just picture myself there somehow.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"After reading the first two books in this series, I hoped the third would be as good if not better than the first two Now on to the forth book in this series, and I have no doubt that it will be just as good as the first three. Very creative story and well written.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed this story, although it was predictable. It is a nice summer read. I plan on reading the next book in the series.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I gave it 5 stars because it was a spell binding story with murder and intrigue all thru the book.Also the mating of two unknown wolves turned into a great sexy alpha & mate.  The entire book could not be put down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this story. It was nice to actually read a novel in this genre. Usually they tend to be short stories or novellas without much story line. This one was not like that. I am looking forward to reading the next story. I hope it is just as good.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was not at all what I expected!  It's a really unique look at the way they live, play, fight,...and yes, mate.  The Mating (Law of the Lycans), was a fun and interesting read.  The writer does a great job of foreshadowing without giving too much away.  Just a few words of caution though, there are quite a few racy scenes so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is too young or who is not comfortable with that kind of writing.  Give this one a chance!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I have started reading alot about vampires and werewolves here lately, and I have to say this is one of the best one's yet I have read. It didnt go to fast as in jumping around, I understood the book at every page. I couldnt put it down til it was finished. Have downloaded the next books in the series and am hoping they are all just like this one..A must read..",5
B00BTIDW4S,First off I loved it !! I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters they felt so real. I would recommend this book to all.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Was looking for a way to pass a few hours and came across this.  Needless to say it took up a few days, but overall a good read.  Easy storyline and lots of sex and alpha maleism.  Elsie is married off to a local alpha to help secure pack lands.  it was a bit of a slow start, but there was drama and a twisting plot.  She and the alpha try to find their way but are pushed by his pack politics.  You aren't sure who the villain is until the end.  I would read the rest of the series",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book has so much, it keeps you hooked from the beginning all the way through. I about to read the other Two again. Nicky is a very good author and I plan to read more of her books.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this book and can't wait to read the next.  I couldn't put it down.  I will not tell the plot, but I promise you that this is a MUST read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Another great novel that I enjoyed immensely. I really do hope Damien is in the next book I really love that character but Ryne is quite interesting too.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have read these books several times now and they still grip me and suck me in (which is usually hard for me since once I know the outcome usually the book and suspense have lost their appeal). I enjoyed the authors writing style and the twists and turns. I loved how each book was mainly about different couples, the other characters still made appearances as the story evolves. Somewhat predictable, does have a few scenes though that'll throw ya for a loop! Like most Lycan/Werewolf stories there is lots of passion and high emotions. I could stand to see a few more books come out of this series!!Review posted on bookaddict.tumblr.com",4
B00BTIDW4S,It was so interesting nd romantic and everything you need in life. JUST READ IT OKAY ! Then you'll understand what I'm talking about because there is no better review then your own!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this story and it was free!  What a wonderful treat for me!  This story had everything, love, friendship, suspense, intrigue wonderful characters an interesting plot and great sex. I just love sexy, dominant Alpha men and sweet, loving strong women, what more could you ask for?  I fell in love with the Author and her talented writing, the story kept my attention all the way through till the end.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked the prequel,but this was even more enjoyable. I'm still in shock that I'm so into werewolf love stories. I can't wait to read the next story. The stories are mysterious, loving, sexy, fun.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I absolutely loved this book.  I thought it was a fantastic paranormal romance novel.  I would definitely recommend this amazing book to anyone and everyone.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I was instructed to read Betrayed & Bonded before The Mating, which I did.  I thought both were extremely well written and great storylines, action and character development.  I really enjoyed The Mating as well, however as another review mentioned, it is told from perspective of primary female character, Elise.  I really like reading and knowing thoughts and feelings from both main characters in a book, however with that, I still believe it was a great read.  And most important thing to mention about Elise is that although naive, please remember she is ONLY 18 YRS OLD.The other comment would be my confusion as to reading Betrayed and Bonded prior to this book.  I suppose in order to answer that question I must read the final two books to tie everything together.  Looking forward to it.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Story line was good. It was so obvious, Elsie was the only frustrating character. And she was the main character. She's so dumb.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles writes with great attention to detail  and with an imagination that brings the reader right into the story.  Her characters feel like people you actually know, their world is your world! Very realistic, and the love scenes specific yet tasteful.  Brava, Nicky!  Well done!",5
B00BTIDW4S,It is a great story that will keep you dragged in. I couldnt put it down at all. Definately not PG and I am so jealous of the woman in this book! Mmmhhmm!,5
B00BTIDW4S,Ok...I admit I originally downloaded this book because I was looking for something sexy to read but I have to say that the underlying back story and story itself was captivating. I didn't want to stop reading. I really wish there was a sequel. Amazing read and totally we worth the time,5
B00BTIDW4S,I so absolutely loved this book I can't wait to start the next one in the series. Best read in a long time.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"From the moment I started reading this book, I was immediately drawn in. Characters were strong, the plot was interesting and . Well established. Although the story is like others, if was different. I loved the book from start to finish. I am thrilled to start the next. Great job Nicky Charles!!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I Love this book! I got it because it was free and I was looking for something to read. There were alot of bad reviews and I was weary about reading it, but as soon as you start you won't be able to put it down. Its great!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Very nicely written; grips you and pulls you into story. Cant wait to read more from this author  - and very soon.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"My interest was held throughout entire book. Even though I knew the direction ln which the story was headed at times, there always seem to be a twist in it I wasn't expecting.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book is a werewolf story about young adults in a male ordered society, arranged marriages, magical transformations, and pack life.  It is a great introduction to the werewolf genre.  The story is split between action and romance and is told predominately from the woman's view point.  It is a fun read and made me want to go immediately into the next book in the series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I have to admit that I am overly enjoyed Nicky Charles decided to make this an actual long book. I'm sure it would have been wonderful as a short one. I have actually been reading a lot lately and (something that hasn't been on my to do list) I'm glad I chose to give this a try. It was an absolutely wonderful read. I was impressed by the whole book. I would definitely recommend this book to any and all. You won't regret it! I can't wait to read her next book about Law of the Lycans! I'll definitely be checking out and keeping an eye for more of her books! I was very impressed!!!!! WAY TO GO NICKY CHARLES!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love books about werewolves, vampires and such. So this one was right up my alley. I loved it from beginning to end and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of story!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"At first when I read all the people putting the book down for the sexism I thought, uh, the book is called ""The Mating"" what did they expect? That title tells you right there what you are in for. However I did not expect this book to be written so pathetically. I want to say something nice because this book was free. So I'll say it, it's nice that the book is free, because if I had paid for it I would have been annoyed. This book is one of those books you keep reading because you think it HAS to get better, and then you don't want to give up because you invested the time!! Kind of a catch 22. Let me clue you in, it doesn't get better, trust me.I like good character development and I don't have to ""like"" the characters, but I do have to understand the characters. The heroine in this is DAFT, irritating and lame. I don't understand why the hero would like her, or fall in love with her other than she is a good lay. I have never read a book where the woman was so stupid. The hero was written as a protector, and I wondered just what it was he was supposed to be protecting, her stupidity? The plot was right out of the 1970's TV era. Very predictable and not clever in the least.Don't waste your time like I did. I will not waste another minute even if it was free. My time is worth more.",1
B00BTIDW4S,Elise and Kane's story is just as enthralling as when I read Bonded. Nicky Charles is an excellent writer and I can't wait to continue reading more of her work. free download,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book! I read the whole thing in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves romance and suspense. Very good book and I will be downloading the sequels.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"If you like werewolf stories, you will love this story. I read thru the night to find out what was happening. I found it exciting, interesting and at times funny. Would recommend highly.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Great read would recommend this book to friends. The story is of friends and love.  Culture and heritage are intertwined.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I read all the books in this..and found it a great read. I cared about the characters and cheered them on to happiness. Check it out..if you are into paranormal, youll like this...",4
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles is a wonderful author.  All or her paranormal series involving Lycans are enjoyable reading.  Her characterizations of various humans and werewolves are keen and interesting.I would suggest that you read the books in the order she prescribes.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"'The Mating (Law of the Lycans, Book 1)' is a powerfully dramatic and beautifully written paranormal werewolf romantic suspense novel. It had me gripped from the very beginning! The main character, Elise, has just been mated to the Alpha of a neighbouring pack, however this was not her choice of mate. Between her father, The Elders and Kane, the Alpha she is mated to, it was decided it was in the best interests of both packs to have these two young people mated to create a political alliance between the two packs and help maintain the wolves territories.The reader initially feels sad for Elise, being forced into such an arrangement, without anybody caring for her feelings.  There are very passionate and sensuous love scenes between two people that may not even be right for each other, and yet the wolf's instinct inside takes over. Kane reaches out for Elise, taking into account that she's in unfamiliar territory and unsure of the whole situation. This helps the reader view Kane in a good light, realising that he too is in this predicament but willing to be caring and positive towards Elise and his future with her.However, to make matters worse, Elise had formed a closer relationship with her longtime friend, Bryan. Elise had grown up with Bryan and so he is familiar and comfortable and she loves spending time with him, roaming the woods and running free. They were on the verge of taking things to the next level when the whole issue of being mated with Kane arose. As it was agreed by so many, so quickly Elise and Kane were mated that night, leaving a whole bunch of questions and emotions swimming around Elise's mind. How was Bryan feeling about this? Will she ever grow to love Kane, or will their relationship just be physical? Does she have it in her to be an Alpha-female?That being said, despite the uncertainties, I'm sure many a woman wouldn't mind having Kane as their Alpha and mate with his domination, possessiveness, and love - not to mention his dark floppy hair, rippling muscles and his whole sexiness!!! Throughout the whole mating process and thereafter, Kane is very sensual and passionate and both of their animalistic instincts kick in when it comes to their physical relationship. I thought Kane was a hot character (if you haven't noticed already!) who tries in his own way to make Elise feel comfortable and when he isn't too busy being the Alpha of his pack he does take the time to empathise with the situation that Elise is in. He understands that she is lost when she leaves her pack to stay with him and his pack, surrounded by strangers who are quite possibly sizing her up and making up their own minds on whether or not she can live up to her status as their Alpha-female.Throughout the novel there is the ongoing worry of the Oil Company and how their decisions will affect the pack and their land. I love how Nicky Charles keeps the reader involved with this plot, despite concentrating on the main characters and their personal relationship. At around three quarters through the book Elise begins to write down all of the recent serious problems that the pack have been having and who the problems are associated with to try and piece the puzzle together. There are the main suspicions as to who is behind the trouble but the question is why. With Elise making these lists it provides the reader with an update on the goings on, keeping the reader constantly aware of the whole story. I thought this was written very cleverly.Aside from Elise and Kane, there are many other great supporting characters in 'The Mating'. One of my favourites being Helen. Helen was the Alpha-female prior to Elise and she lost her mate and Alpha, Zack, in an awful car accident. Helen still lives in the Alpha house and takes pride in cooking and hosting for guests. She provides Kane with a motherly figure and offers a great deal of advice to Elise which really helps Elise to feel welcome and accepted in her new pack as the Alpha-female.On the opposite end of the scale, the reader becomes acquainted to Marla. Marla is calculating, jealous and manipulative. She has a history with Kane and also his half-brother, Ryne. Marla loves reminding Elise regularly that she knows Kane better than her and tries to manipulate Elise in order to get what she wants. She is a great villainous character that the reader will just love to hate. I can assure you that Marla will get under your skin.The reader's knowledge of Ryne throughout most of the book comes mostly from what we are told by Helen, Kane and Marla. After Zack's death he wished to be Alpha of the pack and challenged Kane to fight for the position. Once Ryne lost the challenge, although being asked to stay as Beta, he decided to leave the pack in the hope of starting his own! But, Ryne is hot-headed, impulsive and strongly wanted the position of Alpha. And it was really since Zack's death that the pack began having so many troubles.The whole story comes to a powerful crescendo and is very dramatic. It reaches the reader on all levels of emotion throughout. Will the pack's problems be resolved? Will they be able to prove who was behind their troubles? How will this affect Elise and Kane's relationship? Will they find love or will their relationship remain purely physical?I would like to thank one of our followers for suggesting this novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Enjoy! I cannot wait to read the sequel!",5
B00BTIDW4S,The story gets deeper and you become more engrossed in the story line and cheering for certain character in the book,5
B00BTIDW4S,This is the second book in this series I have read so far - I have read the prequel to Mating and now this one - and I am heading straight to the next one - I can't seem to get enough of them - definitely a must read if you like werewolves,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved the story! It was a fast read! The only part I didn't like was it took the female lead so long to finally  realize what was going on.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Elise is pushed into an arranged marriage to Kane. Kane is an Alpha from a pack that she has never met. After the mating she moves with Kane to his pack. Someone is trying to sabotage their land & their marriage. This is an exciting book that has a few twists and turns...can't wait to read the next one I. The series;),4
B00BTIDW4S,"Maybe I had high hopes for this book because of all the good reviews, but I couldn't even finish it. It was boring, slow , lacked common sense and seemed to need editing. The main female character was pretty much an idiot with no real confidence or common sense. I mean for someone who's grown up as the alpha s daughter u would think she would be on the ball. I've never given a bad review before, and of course this is just my perspective. But she pretty much caused all her own problems by being passive and completely unsure of herself not too mention naive. Blah! I just couldn't get past the fact that she kept so much from her mate. I might give the second book a try, after all with so many good reviews it can only get better, right?",1
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this book. However, I do get so tired of the wimpy main female characters. Elise knew something was off about Marla. I hate when they don't follow their gut.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Great read, such intricacies of plot, i skipped ahead and back again, great set up for number two! You feel so much confusion and unsurity for the heroine...you wonder if things will ever work out for the poor girl.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really loved this book! It showed that even in situations that seem insurmountable; you can find something worth while. They did not close their hearts to the possibilities, and; were rewarded for it.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles wrote a very good science fiction book.  It kept me wanting to keep on reading.  Would like to read more of her stories.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I really liked the story line. The characters were developed well. It was interesting to read this book.  It was a good book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I am appalled at the previous review.  The person obviously did not read the same book I read.  Ms Charles gave good reasons for Elise seeming reluctant but acceptance of the forced marriage.  The Royals in Europe and other countries have done it for centuries. ----- There are still arranged marriages and who but the daughter of an single parent Alpha would follow her father's dictate.------I found Kane intriguing with the pulls of responsibility and love believable.  As far as being taken in by the evil one, he is a male after all.  Treating Elise badly was partially her own fault for not coming clean right a way.  She had her reasons but paid for that  The love scene are erotic while in good taste.------Thanks for the peek at their continued lives in the next book as well.  I recommend this to anyone with a penchant for werewolf tales.  I read the first couple of chapters and got the rest of the series.  Read the first two books in two days and am ready the start the third.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I have never read anything written by this author and I must say I was truly impressed. I love the story in itself and the characters are quite alluring. Intriguing. I look forward to reading much much more.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"For those that enjoy a well thought out sci-f i story... here is a good one.  A great,well written book with twists and turns to keep the reader involved.  The author does a terrific job setting the scene for the books to follow.  Somewhat descriptive love scenes... not for all readers, but definitely intriguing.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"After reading and enjoying Bonded by Nicky Charles a while back I decided to read the other books in the series with some high expectations. I&#8217;m not sure if these expectations were a little too high for the other books to meet since I found myself not liking The Mating as much as I did Bonded. It wasn&#8217;t a bad book, but just comparing with the other book it didn&#8217;t have the same likeability.As a whole, I felt the story was pretty simple. Although I did like the conflict regarding the oil company, all the disturbances happening around the pack and the mystery behind who&#8217;s at the core of it and how they connect to each other. Specifically, my concerns center around the development of Kane and Elise and their relationship. I wanted a more in depth evolution of Elise through her arranged mating to Kane and living with a new pack. I thought it would&#8217;ve served her character to have her grow into her role as an alpha female and handle all the responsibility that goes along with it. I was a little disappointed that the book was mostly in Elise&#8217;s narrative since I would&#8217;ve liked to see things from Kane&#8217;s perspective. It also would&#8217;ve given me, as a reader, a more personal look into his inner workings rather than hearing his story from the other characters. I think these details would&#8217;ve helped with the development of their relationship. I didn&#8217;t really feel the connection between them. In fact, a lot of the story was spent with Kane and Elise not even being in the same room with each other, having Kane being off doing alpha duties. There wasn&#8217;t very many moments where you see any real connection being created. So when they proclaim their love for each other, it didn&#8217;t feel genuine to me.The book as a whole was an alright read, where you can just casually just lay back with it and read. The book could&#8217;ve been better if more time was spent of delving a little deeper into the characters and their relationship with each other. Throughout the whole read I just felt like the story was just skimming the surface. Maybe my feelings from the previous book skewed my view of this book, but I thought the book could&#8217;ve been more than just a &#8220;good&#8221; read.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book and all the other s he had written. The story line  had a nice flow and did not skip around. Detail was great without doing to much.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"On the one hand, Elise, the lead female, has absolutely no backbone throughout this book except maybe twice.  She is supposed to be mated with an Alpha, that alone meant (IMO) she should be exerting her power over the other characters, especially when they are rude or disrespectful to her.  She is also a very naive main character in an arranged marriage (mating), which makes for some immature scenes.There were many parts I enjoyed about this book, after all I basically read for 3 hours straight before admitting I should at least try to get some sleep before waking up early the next day.  Kane, the Alpha, his character was definitely lacking.  I'm bored with the constant need for the 2 lover characters of so many romance novels to never admit their true feelings until something goes wrong or something bad happens to one or the other.  Same typical story here.  I wish Kane had been more developed as a character and that their bond had solidified much sooner in the storyline so we got to know them as a couple better.I've also read this series out of order, as I started with this one first, and will continue to the sequel, without reading the prequel.  But maybe thats ok.",3
B00BTIDW4S,This is my favorite book so far in the series. The third book if you read them in order. Kane the new Alpha of his pack makes an alliance with the neighboring pack by mating with the Alpha's daughter Elise. A great story of how they fall in love while trying to keep the pack from loosing their territory.Great series five stars!,5
B00BTIDW4S,The book kept me interested till the end. Loved the third party that involved Brian and how author wrote him in the book. Looking forward to book 2. This book kept me up til I finished reading.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Is a pretty well written story, though it repeats alot in beginning.. feels like it was done to fill space.. first sexual discretion was a bit wham, but story picks up a bit after.. I recommend, mostly seeing as its a free read :-)",3
B00BTIDW4S,"Good story line, Highly entertaining book and so nice to cuddle up with even though i got hot under the collar reading these pages. Please people, for mature audiences only.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Words to describe.  Just what it says and so discriptive it was indeed, but still love reading it anyway.  Great book",5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good book first book that I have readAbout just Luciana wish to find more well written books such as this,5
B00BTIDW4S,As soon as I finished this book I had to down load them all.  Nicky Charles is an absolutely wonderful story teller.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Despite the heroine being young age wise I liked how the writer managed to have this character ""grow up"", if you will, and not be completely oblivious to the situations she found herself in. It was definitely a page turner and I hope the writer intends to continue this series with the remaining characters as I would love to see where this story goes.",4
B00BTIDW4S,This was a good book. I intend to explore all of Nicky Charles books after my experience with this one.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"In this third book of this series, we meet Elise and Kane. Kane was briefly mentioned in book one when he was in college, but now is the Alpha of a Lycan pack in the Pacific Northwest, having been challenged by, and defeating, his brother for the position. In order to cement allies and expand friendly borders, Kane seeks a mate from a neighboring pack. Elise is the youngest daughter of the neighbor Alpha and is the right age to marry. Her father and Kane do all the negotiations, and Elise is informed that she has three hours to get ready for her mating ceremony. Despite her growing attachment to a male in her pack, Elise goes through with the alliance mating ceremony because it's what she's been raised to do.Kane is a good alpha and a good man, even if he sometimes forgets he has a wife. Elise meets some new friends and is made to feel very welcome by her new pack, mostly . It becomes clear, though that there are problems; a guard is shot while on patrol, traps are found along the edge of the pack's lands, areas are contaminated with oil spills, the old Alpha died under mysterious circumstances and an oil company wants to buy pack lands and isn't taking ""no"" for an answer. With all these pressures, it's hard for a newlywed couple to spend time together, but Kane and Elise try to make the time to get their relationship off on the right foot.The problems start to point to Kane's defeated brother, Ryne, as the culprit, but this news devastates Kane. He can't believe his own brother fought him for the Alpha position and then would sabotage his old friends and family like this. Elise can't believe it either. Something just doesn't add up for her. Maybe it's because she's an unbiased newcomer, maybe it's because she's starting to fall in love with her husband, but whatever the reason she starts poking around. When the real saboteur realizes someone's onto them, how long will Elise stay safe? Will Kane listen to her suspicions, or will their relationship be another thing broken by whoever's undermining the pack?Kane and Elise have a very hard row to hoe with their relationship. Both of them are young but are in positions of great authority and are supposed to be and act wisely.That would be hard enough if they knew each other, but they had an approximately fifteen minute courtship. They're still learning what the other person likes to eat, much less governing a pack in a time of crisis and Elise learning how to have sex. There is a lot of growing and compromising on the way in this story.As always, this author does not charge for her books, asking readers to instead make a donation to a local animal shelter or food bank.Heat factor hot.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Amazing....I highly recommend this book. I can't waiting to read the sequel to this book.  I could read this book again. Yes, it's that good.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I read the reviews and bought this book anyway..THANKFULLY!!! they were wrong I LOVED this whole series I have read them all and they were great...,4
B00BTIDW4S,I was captivated by the first chapter. I fell in love with the characters. I hope to read more books by this author.  I recommend this author. Good book!!!!!!!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This story starts out with Elise, a young girl, who thinks she's in love with Bryan. Bryan is a young man. A member of her pack. Her werewolf pack.

She doesn't know Kane and has no wish to marry someone she doesn't know. After all. Its the 21st century and political marriage should be a thing of the past even with the archaic thinking of her pack. JeezeKane is one hunk. He's tall with black hair and blue eyes and handsome doesn't begin to describe him. Even so. Elise prefers Bryan.After the ceremony They head for Kanes home territory and Elise is starting her new life as the mate of an Alpha male.On arrival she meets many of the pack. John, Kanes Beta, his wife. She also meets Helen. The wife of Zach who was Alpha before Kane.

Kane tried to get Ryne to stay but Ryne decided to leave.Ryne is a gifted photographer and one of his photos is for sale and a local shop. A photo that will come back to haunt everyone.Loads of things happening on the pack land. Oil that was spilled by someone has become an environmental mess that needs cleaning up. Rynes scent is all over the area.An Oil company is trying to buy that part of the pack territory to search for oil.One of the pack on patrol is shot and Ryne's scent is there as well. In fact Ryne is getting the majority of the blame for all thats gone wrong on the pack land.All is not what it seems though.A well written book. I already have the others in the series and am looking forward to reading them all.Five stars",5
B00BTIDW4S,I overheard my human telling a friend how much he was enjoying Nicky's books but expresseg concern that he might be going just a bit too Jackie Collins. I have no idea what he was talking about (I'm still just a pup) However I will admit to its explicit content getting me a little hot under the collar! How do I convince my human that I'm not too young for a mate?  Marco the Springer Spaniel.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Excellent story with  plenty of suspense and intrigue.Definitely must read for those with a since of adventure and an open mind,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book by Nicky Charles is very well written and her characters were very well developed I can't wait to read more of her books..,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Enjoyed this freebie so much that I finished it in one day!  Hope to find more by this author, especially if this begins a new series.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this book and you can't beat the price because it's free. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it was all from Elise' s point of view. Only once at the end for about a page did they give Kanes. I like a book that lets you have both the hero and heroines view.,4
B00BTIDW4S,From beginning to end this book kept my attention to the point of exhaustion (which is a good thing). Sounds like a sequel at the end but no mention so off to find out. Great story line that doesn't just stop abruptly. Very well worth the read!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"First time I've read this genre and I'm hooked. Loved the characters,very well developed.  werewolves,love.steam, intrigue...what more could you ask for.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Loved the story and will read it again. I want to pack my bags and move in. (25 years ago, lol) I found that the proofreader needed to not rely so much on spell check and more on good old fashioned proofreading. It is nice that you don't need the money but I would have purchased this book and would have liked to have a set of these in hardback signed (of course) for my collection. Keep up with the wonderful love of sharing your unique way of letting us into your world. God bless you.",5
B00BTIDW4S,There was enough character development to make the story hold interest.  Good first novel - will read the sequel to see where the story goes..,4
B00BTIDW4S,"get this book and the whole series. Has to be one of my favorites out of the series. Its not you run of the mill werewolf novel. It has all the good elements ; great story line great characters who develop with the story, sex, action, twist and even better there are more books and you get so see you favorite characters progress. Get the book come on its FREE!! Then get the series NOW!",5
B00BTIDW4S,great author and book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Lots of 5 star reviews.....I liked this books.....and I could really like it A LOT.  Interesting plot, good development of characters.  But...The author's use of passive voice (overuse of &#34;auxiliary verbs&#34; -- am, is are, was, were, be, been, etc.....) drove me nuts.  If she would simply grab that active voice it would have put readers more &#34;in the moment&#34; (ie: she was running&#34;.  No!  &#34;she ran&#34;).  Occasional typos didn't bother me so much.I readily read along...until I hit that 83% mark.  I'm not going to recap it all because I don't want spoilers for anyone, but suffice it to say that that climax of the book simply seemed to be thrown at the reader and rather clich&eacute;d.  The antagonist simply blurts out the entire plan....and she comes off as being pretty much a dolt in the process.I will still read the rest of the books in this series, but I am hoping Book Two wraps up in a more matured author voice than this one.",3
B00BTIDW4S,You should read this first before the others. It's a good story with some adult content. There's good detailing and a moving storyline.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved every moment of this book. I could not put it down. I am looking forward to reading more of you work.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to say that this was my introduction to Nicky Charles and what a really great way to be introduced!  This book is very tame in comparison to other paranormal romance stories, but that does not mean it isn't a fantastic read!Elise is a beautiful character to watch grow, and her love with Kane is one that is fun to explore.  Kane is very sweet and gentle, not your typical Alpha male, but he has substance and you respect him a great deal.  These two together are sweet and thoughtful.The secondary characters are also well developed and the story is the beginning of a trilogy of books that all follow the same theme.  Just because your the alpha male, doesn't mean you have to be a bossy over the top ass.  You can be gentle and enduring and still formidable when you need to be.So yes, if you need something a little less intense and you are looking for a beautiful love story, and you happen to love wolf lore, then pick this series up!  Even better right now....it's free on Amazon!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a nice blend of romance, suspense, and x rated scenes.  I hope you intend to write on about Ryne. Can't wait to see who will catch his eye.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Elise is told by her father, the Alpha, that she is to be mated that day to the Alpha from the pack next door. She has no say in the matter and is mated to him and whisked away to the other pack.This is a good paranormal romance/ romantic suspense/ mystery book. It is part of a series but could stand on its own.I like this book. It is full length and I got really invested in these wolves!This book is after Bonded and followed by The Keeping.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to admit, ive been jaded by the era of Twilight and its followers that told stories of taboo paranormal love experiences, but by introducing this series with two werewolves paired together i was definitely more willing to finish the book and it was well worth it! Their main interactions being with all werewolves and not any human/werewolf relationships in this opening book helped to focus on the romance which i feel is lost in books like Twilight where so much energy throughout the first three books is focused on the ""should i/shouldn't i"" struggle. Here Elise and Kane are both werewolves and they are both just focused on their compatibility and her fitting in to the new pack while providing information that sets up future books in the series. This provides future books the opportunity to focus on complex human/werewolf etc. relationships without going into great detail of the pack mentality laid out appropriately in book one. I recommend all the books by this author, especially because the other two in this direct series are free on amazon.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Loved this book. The author created some great characters and kept me turning the pages without being able to put the book down. I went on to read the next two in the series, finishing all three in three days!  A fun romp and feel good escape!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Yes the manipulation by Marla to Elise and her mate really started to wear on me but I enjoyed the story never the less, and downloaded the other three for free by this author and plan to read them, hopefully the other women wont be so gullible.",3
B00BTIDW4S,Great book.  First time reading a werewolf book.  I would like more background on their history.  Hard to  imagine werewolves  sitting down to dinner eating mashed potatoes and meatloaf.  Great sex scenes!  Keep the side stories  going so it  doesn't just turn into a typical romance novel.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I really liked this book. Since then I've read 2 other's in the series.  All were very good.  Can't wait to read other books by this author.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Such a great refreshing story. I loved whole idea of honor among this pack of werewolves. All of my questions were answered, including the manner of returning to human form fully clothed. Yes, I loved this book, flat out could not put it down! 5 star rating for sure",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a good read to pass some time. I agree with some of the other reviews I read. There was some repetition, which I simply skimmed over, and the lead female character was too passive for my tastes. But, perhaps that is a young she wolf's way in a pack society..I don't know.",4
B00BTIDW4S,excellent story and I loved the the excitement of how the packs are ran. the alphas are like the strongest panties wetting......,4
B00BTIDW4S,This series will keep happy and then make you want to come for more. I would recommend this to anyone with a vivid imagination like mine!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I did not enjoy this book as much as The Bonding it was more predictable more drawn out and felt just too long. I wanted to skip ahead and find out what happened. Sorry as I really enjoyed your other one.,3
B00BTIDW4S,I WAS NOT SURE THAT I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT.HOWEVER I WAS VERY SURPRISED. I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY HOW WELL WRITTEN IT REALLY does grab your imaginationI would like to thank you for your fantastically written  BOOK.David,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I've never really been into romance novels or of werewolves but, I decided to give it a try. Delightfully, it was the best novel I've ever read! In my opinion, it was well thought out and very seemingly made it to a point of wonder on possibilities of what we don't know out there. It is a very good thrilling romance novel! I plan on reading it again and keeping up with Nicky Charles and his other books from now on as well",5
B00BTIDW4S,Good riveting read good follow up to her first book can't wait to read the last one in this series,5
B00BTIDW4S,I like the way these young women go from being shy to fearsome  and  emotionally tuff  Thank you again for your stories.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Loved this story. It was intense, the character's had such powerful emotions. But I could have used a little less hot and steamy ( which were great) sex scenes and maybe more sneak peeks into some of the other characters",4
B00BTIDW4S,Wonderful story I really enjoyed this book!!! Can't wait to start the next one in theSeries.Love the character's!!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I thought that this book was very good.  The suspense and mystery kept me intrigued enough to hardly putting the book down. I recommend this book for an adult.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I liked the book. There's an actual plot to go along with the romance. The twist is one that you don't quite see coming. I hope there's a follow up with regards to Ryne's life and mate. Because you know there will be one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to admit that Vampires and Fallen Angels are my favorite supernaturals. However, Nicky Charles has given me a new category of supernaturals to love-Kane! I mean werewolves. I enjoyed the book. It was well written. If you love werewolf novels I highly recommend this book. Lots of action, mild sexual content, and one sexy Alpha!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"As with the other reviews, my feelings are the same. I thought it was a great series. Read it and enjoy.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I read some pretty harsh reviews about this book. There weren't many but after reading the book I am wondering if they were reading the same book. I love the story and the characters. It was very well written and had you guessing as to what would happen next. I recommend this book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a very good book, especially surprising for a free book. Great sex scenes and built up romance. The initial separation between the two was well developed in the story. Aside from a few typos here and there, the writing itself was of a good quality. There was a scene with dubious consent between the two main characters, which may trigger a response in some readers.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I have absolutely fallen in love with the books that Nicky Charles has written. The Mating is such an amazing book. I love the characters. The story is awesome. Very well written. Nicky Charles is a very talented author. I love when I can't put a book down. Highly recommended,5
B00BTIDW4S,"What can I say, I so loved this book, and for free it is The Best Free Book I have ever read. If you are in to shifter/werewolf,s this it the book for you",5
B00BTIDW4S,"What a story!!!  It has everything ... romance, drama, romance a little comedy, romance, lots of love, some sex and a very great whodunit story!!!!  Thank you for good reading!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This series must be geared to junior high level readers. It is very trite with predictable plots. Pass on this series if you are over 13,2
B00BTIDW4S,I really liked this series and can't wait to read the other books in this series. I fell in love with Kane & Elisa...I can't wait to read about the other wolf shifters.  I have read several wolf paranormal romance Books and can honestly say I fell in love with almost every character in this book. MARLA..not SO much...I saw through her from the start.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Wow, I didn't expect this to be so intense and catches my attention!  Finished this book within 2 days! Really good series!  Keep it up and I will read them all!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a great story of romance, mystery and danger.  Well written and kept me in suspense to the dramatic end.I look forward to reading the next book in the series.",4
B00BTIDW4S,This was an exciting book. The characters were believable and the plot was good I would have liked for Elise to have a bit more sense than she had. It was as if she had to be hit in the head before she put two and two together.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"I was quite impressed, loved the story and the struggle the characters faced to get to know each other. my only complaint is the length of time Elise took to assert herself.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I picked this up as a freebie and thought it was a good start of the series.I was able to read this cover to cover and overall I enjoyed it.  I found a couple things to be a little on the predictable side, but I like the character building.I did get the rest of the series, and I want to know what happens to them which is why I gave it 4.  I cared enough about them to want to find out more.There were a couple mixed messages, but overall a solid read. I would pay up to 3.99 for this without a problem with price.  If you are in to paranormal, read it.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"And between the hot and steamy scenes...a story of misunderstanding, greed, heartache, love...Communication is the key word for a better world.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I think the story was well paced, a good sequence of events, but there was just something missing. I enjoyed the characters and the plot, but...maybe there was too much dialogue, not enough background or description. I am truly hoping the rest of the series gets better.",3
B00BTIDW4S,First off I would like to thank you for the free book. It was well writen and kept me wanting to find out how the storie ended. I did figure out who the bad guy was early in after she was introduced. It was no big shock to see it play out. What was left out was what happened to the bad girl. I'm glad that the main characters worked out everything. I enjoyed the book and will look for more from this writer .I don't like to give spoilers so if you want to know what happens you will just have to read it your self.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Loved the first book in this series. The story line progressed well and kept you guessing on who to like and dislike. Just enough romance to balance the drama.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I normally do not read stories with paranormal romance in the title and werewolves forget it!!! But Nicky Charles had me hook line and sinker.... I didn't want to put it down....,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked the first chapter - and, I'm afraid, that's all. The first chapter suggested it was going to be a romance, two characters discovering each other, but it was not - well, not really. It was more a fantasy book than a love story. I didn't enjoy it very much.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"The book is very good, it holds your attention , and it didn't take long to read, when you don't want to put it down.....If you like the werewolves story line, you will like this book.  And I am going to read the next book in this series....",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I went through this story very quickly. I loved it! It provides mystery, love, passion and intrigue. I gave it only 4 stars because it is rather predictable. But I still loved it and am going to read all the rest in this series and everything else by this author. They are free!I have to say it is more romance than I usually read. In fact I don't read romances. But this is much more than a romance and very sexy so give it a whirl. I mean a read.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Chales did it again. I just couldn't put the book down. It kept you in suspense at times, wondering how everything was going to turn out. A very good read. Now for the next one.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Really enjoyed this book. Great characters and although I pegged the first villain early in the book. I did enjoy the surprise of the second villain. Thank you for an entertaining read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I liked the book.  You get a good sense of who the people are and the story is great. Thanks.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved reading this one as well as the first...please keep the Lycan series going! I can't wait to start the next one!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I absolutely love this book!!  I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series!!:) I recommend.thsi book to anyone who really likes werewolves (SEXY WEREWOLVES AT THAT)!!!!:D,5
B00BTIDW4S,Great for a lycan story line and I hope there is a sequel using the new pack! Thanks for the read!  ciscaroni@Gmail,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The author is great with dialogue, the book is professionally edited and it's a fun read. The best free book I've read yet.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a beautifully written story about a new alpha and the arranged marriage between him and a woman he has never met.  it is full of colorful personalities and a measure of suspense mixed in.  Kane was briefly mentioned in the prequel when he was a student at the training academy along with his brother.  Now we have his story and the journey toward true connection and real love he must find along with his new mate.  It is a very entertaining read and will be appreciated by those who enjoy good paranormal romance fiction.  There will be love and loss, trust and suspicion, bravery and betrayal, and two individuals who will discover the power in togetherness.  This author was new for me before reading the prequel.  I am so glad I got this next  took in the series",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a great series.  Emotions and suspense!  Marla was so evil and well written.  I rarely get so in to a book that I want to yell out loud at the characters, but....this book did it",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a fantastic read.  The author did a wonderful job with the characters and the story line.  Highly recommend!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have often found that the second book in a series is usually disappointing.  That is not the case here.  This book is just as good as the first.  Very well written, with wonderful characters.  The continuity between books is so good that I can't wait to get to the next book.  Keep writing this well, Nicky, and you will bring joy to a great many readers now and in the future.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoy Nickys novels and the fact all she asks is you to donate to the animal shelter . I am sad to see she has had to charge now for them because they were being pirated. I loved the characters and story . I was disappointed to see bad reviews but you can't please everyone. Keep writing Nicky because your loyal fans love you!!!!!,4
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written with believable characters.  She didn't just rely on sex to make the book. It had a lot of action and suspense as well.  I also think it's awesome that she brings her books for free.  I'm working my way through every one of her books.  Don't want to miss any.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Very good book. Intriguing story keeps you reading could not put this book down. Happy the brothers reconciled ,family trumps all",5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved the book never read about werewolves before and was really interesting. But I don't think Marla will give up that easily. But I guess we'll wait and see about to start the second book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating is a wonderful tale of two very different individuals, thrust together, and now forced to face an uncertain future.  I found this novel to be a fantastic read, it is fast-paced and, once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down.  With each chapter I found myself needing to know what was going to happen next.  The characters are wonderful and the storyline is great - with a couple of twists that I found to be a real treat.  I look forward to reading more from this author and recommend this book to everyone!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was pretty good. But not as good as the previous two that I read. I think I would have liked it more if there had been Kane's POV. He had a brief few pages towards the end but that was it. I spent a good amount of time wondering what he was feeling and thinking. All the drama and scheming was pretty much obvious. You know who the baddie is (for me at least) right away. But there was a nice twist at the end. This author is so talented that I cant wait to read the next book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,This was  a really nice story.. I really enjoyed the no nonsense and true feeling of it.  Most werewolf stories are to far fetched!!  But this was a wonderful and believable book.  I would love for it to become a series.  Still wondering about where the witch Marla went to. ???  Thank u Nicky Charles for a great story. Beth .N,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoy this book.  It was not something I would normal read.  Once I got started I could not put down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The story was sound and the character's were of interest, but I 've read many books where werewolves are more human than wolf and wow they sure are busy in the bedroom!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a great series with lots of humor, sarcasm and fun adventure. If you like werewolves and romance, definitely try this series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but the author did a great job in imagining what it would be like to experience canine& humnan sensations as a werewolf and how that would affect the the characters while in their human form & wolf forms.  The characters were believable and well developed. The plot, although it followed a typical romance story line, had plenty of unexpected events to keep things interesting and evolving.  The sex scenes were erotic but tasteful and served to further the story line.  Readers that are looking for a fantasy that is grounded in believable emotions will really enjoy this book.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I am falling more in love with this series as it goes. I really loved the plot in this book. I felt truly connected to the characters; I felt their confusion, happiness, betrayal, and passion for each other. I am so excited for the fourth book of the series.",4
B00BTIDW4S,It was a great book the drama was great kept you on the edge trying to figure out what will happen next.  The sex scenes or tasteful an not explicit. I can't wait to read the next book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"As always a wonderful story by Nicky, she has a way of putting you right in the middle of it all. The characters are fantastic, there loving, caring, protective, and humorous. It all has you wanting more. Loved It!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"There is a mystery in this story that is simple to figure out, apart from some details. The love story has a lot of passion but also an annoying amount of 'I really need to tell him this but now is not the right moment', all to allow the story to continue. Because if the main characters had just had the good sense to actually speak to each other it would have been a short story instead of a novel.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"I decided to write this in hopes that it will assist those that haven't yet purchased this book or read it - especially since I was disappointed and frustrated, so maybe I can prevent that in someone else.The problem I had with this book was that it failed to fulfill my requirement for ""Romance."" I've read a plethora of paranormal romance novels - many of which were centered around werewolves, vampires, and a combination of the two. I happen to really love this genre, and am well versed with the whole ""me Alpha, you shewolf, I rule"" mentality that some authors use. However, this one just struck me as abusive, awkward, uncomfortable, and just generally all-around frustrating.This book begins with an 18 year old (almost 19) virgin, Elise, who is not only forced to be bonded to a stranger (Kane) for political purposes, but also forced to have sex with that stranger the very night they're introduced. And why? Because the old fashioned Elders dictate it and her father commands her to. Let's not forget that she's in love with someone else while this is occurring, making it doubly heartbreaking and violating.Are we feeling the romance yet? Oh, baby... a girls body being traded for politics and used makes me feel all warm and gooey inside. Especially when she cries and feels ashamed.Maybe it comes from me having spoken with numerous rape victims... who are often ashamed that their bodies responded even when they didn't want to... that makes this book feel violating and dirty. We're confronted with several more episodes of this ""I can't stop my body from responding to you, even as my mind rebels,"" in the front end of the novel. Kane merely ruts on her because she's attractive and they're now mated - but screw intimacy, because who the heck needs that? Meanwhile we still have a very shallow attachment to either of the main characters, since the author hasn't taken the time to give them even a stitch of depth. I suppose that may be why I focused so much on the awkward, violating sex... since there really wasn't much else to focus on. The author attempts to make it seem as though Elise and Kane are ""bonding"" by having them exchange likes and dislikes, but at that point it still really just feels like strangers awkwardly conversing, like ""Hey, I was just forced to have sex with you, maybe we should discuss what kind of books you like to read.""On top of that, we have this mentally abusive werewolf alpha mentality where Elise isn't even able to keep something to herself without being threatened with violence from her ""mate."" Nothing like fear of your mate to really ramp up the romance level, huh? I guess I'm just not into books where the woman is oppressed and bent to the man's will. Doesn't do it for me - not at all.Apparently, being the Alpha in this book also means do as I say and not as I do, since Elise couldn't even speak with her long time [male] friend to say good-bye without Kane suddenly getting between them and scaring the poor guy off with a possessive ""she's mine"" line... but slutty werewolf groupie, Marla, can hang all over Kane and mistreat Elise without anyone saying Boo. Someone needs to give this gal a pamphlet on Spousal Abuse and take her to a shelter. Am I the only one that cringes at this whole situation that the author has concocted?This book isn't sexy, isn't romantic, isn't anything... except disgustingly misogynistic, and not in that steamy manly man way, either.  I remember reading this a couple years ago off of a freebie book site and thinking the same thing, but by the time I remembered I hadn't liked this book I was already half way through.So, if you like the idea of men brow beating women, a woman cringing away from her partner in fear, double standards for men and women, the whole ""be seen and not heard"" concept, and all that other archaic jazz... then this is perfect for you. If not, I recommend passing.",2
B00BTIDW4S,This was written very well.  The characters were totally established as well as the story line.  I enjoyed all of players and roles they represented.  It  was a definite page turner and I had to finish.  At first you thought you'd figured all the angles but there were more twist and turns in this story.  The main characters were strong and honorable individuals and because of that certain persons took advantage them.  In the end many issues had been solved and yet  not all of them.  I would recommend this book I feel most would enjoy.,5
B00BTIDW4S,They some make this novel into a film because each character has some much depth in their character. Some much twist and turns that leaves you wanting to continue on reading. Basically this novel is what a marriage suppose to be. Mating 4-Life with the same Mate!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"If Lycans are real, this is what their world would be all about.  I enjoyed the suspense and intrigue, and even the sexual scenes. Well done.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Well now l know why when people read this book before bonded why they were upset!!! This book was incredible!!! I read the first 3 in the recommended order, bonded than betrayed than mating!!! I'm glad l read them in that order because bonded was no where as good as betrayed and mating!!! Although this book has completely different people in them and could definitely be read as a stand alone. I wasn't sure why the recommended reading order was like that because this book is insanely good but like l wrote before it had nothing to do with the first to. Now I'm on to the 4th book is this series so maybe that one will tie it all together. The epilogue has Ryne starting his new pack in Canada which is where the betrayed had taken place so maybe that's some insight or hint to how they're tied together!! Leave it to Nicky Charles to keep me guessing and wanting more!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"What a great freebie, I read this series very fast it did hook me. Good combination of action, romance and storytelling.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles takes on an indepth look in lives of werewolves.  As readers we have learned to fear these monsters of our dreams.Nicky shows us that we humans have been misinformed and they are just like us in almost every way except they just happen to be werewolves.  Great job on leading us down the path of what it means to be a lycan.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I hadn't read any strictly &#34;werewolf&#34; books before. This one really drew me in, wondering what would happen next. I found myself snatching bits of time everywhere, just to get back to it and find out more.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I am hooked on this series - I loved it.  I think I have read all of them and I can't wait for more,5
B00BTIDW4S,i could not finish reading  the book..when humans started  turning into animals.. that's when i lost interest..but I am sure there are people that could read this book and enjoy it..lots of luck with that..just not my kind of book,2
B00BTIDW4S,Yep. Once again I am loving one of buckets books. Great author. And a great start to an interesting werewolf series. I'm excited to read the next book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I read the book in 2 days I loved it! I immediately fell in love with Elise and Kane. The story through me for a surprise towards the end. Beautiful story can't wait to read the next one!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Don't usually go for mysteries but the Marla situation kept me getting upset at how conniving and manipulative she was and getting away with it. Very good story, had the suspense, romance and mystery.  I could have done without the raw sex, but I still rated it a five.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this book! My only complaint was that I felt the story was a bit one sided with the heroines point of view only. I like a book that shows the perspective of many characters. I was a little taken back by the hero forcing himself on the heroine even though she said no, but to be fair the characters are not completely human and in mating and fighting the animalistic sides come out in all her characters. So, as animals that's what happens!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I didn't know if Kane and Elise would work out a relationship with how they are introduced. The conspiracy around everything in this book just makes it a nail biting, steamy and exciting book. I really like Elise and how she didn't take any crap.  I don't want to give spoilers so I don't want to say who is behind all of the bad stuff that happens.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Wow! This is a great werewolf series! Everyone should read all five of the books. No they are not short and are each a great read in themselves.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this story. It had a lot of plots and great characters. The turns,were great,not expecting them,and a great love story too.",5
B00BTIDW4S,The characters in The Mating were very believable.  The book was well written and enjoyable.  I can't wait to read the sequel.,4
B00BTIDW4S,Loved it ! Just would have loved more of the males point of view. But overall pretty good. Keep it up.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"Got this book free not expecting to much as I'm not usually a werewolf fan BUT was pleasantly surprised, it had everything a good book should have ,great storyline mystery romance suspense !! couldn't put my kindle down until finished. Will definatly be reading more of Nicky Charles .",5
B00BTIDW4S,I really really enjoyed reading this book!!  It was just as good as the last one.  I read the whole thing in one night. I could not put it down!  I can't believe that they are free. I am moving on to the next book in the series!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The story has it all. Hot dominant alphas, mystery and suspense and of course a healthy dash of true love.  I can't wait to read the rest.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I would recommend this series to others..Forget housework, you will find it hard to set this book aside to do anything else.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good series.  The first book gets you wrapped up with the characers.  Additonal books draw you in.  Best free series of books I have ever read.  I'm hooked.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This certainly wasn't what I expected but in a good way. The Mating was entertaining, but I need to know what happened to Marla.  She was definitely a master manipulator! The unsure relationship between Kane and Elise was believable but I felt the ending a little rushed. All in all, great job Ms Charles!",4
B00BTIDW4S,Very good plot. Suspence and lots big heatI read it in one sitting. Cannot wait for the next one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book is a great read especially if you like the world of werewolves. It draws you in immediately and the story continues to be interesting to the end.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Omg!!!! If you like humans, werewolves, tamed pot not then you should totally read this book!!! This book deserves 5 stars baby!!!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"2.75 StarsOk, let me start by saying if you like Shapeshifter books you should at least try this book... I mean it's FREE, right? Maybe I'm just being...obtuse.When I first started reading The Mating I was extremely surprised how interested I was in the story. The whole mating for politics and having to move away from everything you know justbseemed to really keep my interest. I was flying thru the pages on my iPad not able to read fast enough... then all of a sudden...BAM, the story just fell off.All of sudden I lost interest. I got bored and found myself skimming over the paragraphs. There were large gaps in between dialog with the characters which caused me to get bored. I'm still not sure what happened, but it just seemed that there were a lot filler pages (and I can not stand that in a book.) Don't add fillers when you can just shorten the book and keep the readers interested the entire time...but who am I?That being said, I loved Kane and Ryne. Talk about hot alpha males (literally). The sex scenes were pretty hot too, so that made up for a little of my boredom.Would I read this book again? NoWould I recommend this book? Only to people who are true Shapeshifter fans",3
B00BTIDW4S,"Elise is the daughter of a local werewolf pack who get's mated to Kane, a recent Alpha of the East pack. Elise role is to marry into the pack and unite so they'd have a larger area and a peaceful treaty. The story was likable and the sex steamy. It wasn't however an original idea, so that lowered my review. I still liked it but a new approach would have been nice.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I read it straight through, stayed up all night, well I tried to put it down and go to bed but I had to make sure Elise was alright. She is a very likeable heroine. Marla is the perfect antagonist and Kane well he is all man. Kane is likable but infuriating when it becomes clear that he cannot see Marla for what she is (a snake). I love this story and cannot wait to read more. Nicky Charles ...Please Keep it coming, this is better than any Harlequin Romance.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a great story filled with emotions and a mysterious twisted plot. The foundation was solid, the characters were well developed and the emotional journey kept the story interesting. You will get plenty of steam, a little sorrow, frustration, a chuckle or two and a couple rounds of violence. By the end, I felt like I knew the characters personally and loved the story. This story can stand alone, but left a door open for additional story development and character off shoots.  I hope to read more from Nicky Charles.(There were a couple very minor edit errors...simply a missing word or word order swap...they did not detract)",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I choose the rating because I read a lot of free books and this by far was one of the best ones . Not a lot of filer , a good story, and even tho is was a romance it wasn't mushy . Nick Charles you did a really good job.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"After reading the prequel I expected much more. I expected mentioning of Lycan Link, or at least the academy and stuff like this.I did not happen, but it was okay. And then - the ultimately dumb, barely out or puberty main female character. I mean, come on - this was so frustrating. All the clues were there and she was still like the proverbial blinded horse. And when you're married, even unexpectedly and so on, will you ever, ever trust the mean bitch trying to make your life harder since day one?Everything else was good, the writing was as good as the prequel's, but this little nitwit got me fidgeting and angry with her stupidity.I'm already reading the third in the series - so far the heroine there is so obnoxious that I can barely stand her. May be it's just me (I've always hated journalists and their nosy-ness), but even her description was something I disliked.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked it, and I plan to read all the books, am hoping for more adventure ... in all it was pretty good... I enjoyed it. NEXT! :-)",4
B00BTIDW4S,Great beginning to a rich saga.  Werewolf story lovers will thrill to this series.  So elemental!  Lycan lore is explained without being ponderous.  You can't help wanting to join the pack.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good book. Now I am going to read the remaining ones. I would recommend this book. It is well written and tells a very good story.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed reading this book. Great characters, content, and situations. Very easy to follow the story line. Looking forward to more by this author.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book. Love action and family. Can't wait to read the next one.. also we just adopted a dog from a small shelter that was due to be . Put down for no other reason except that he jumped alot and they didn't have the room for him... he's awesome..,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book is an excellent read. Well written and very enjoyable. I recommend this to all lovers of paranormal romance. You'll fall in love with the alpha male.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Although this is the first book by ms. Charles, I have read, it will not be the last.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was just as great as her previous books. I originally thought this was a sequel, but realize, after checking that it is a whole new series. I'm looking forward to reading more books from this series. I will be checking Kindle's book lists for follow-up books. Can't wait to read more. Janice Mote",5
B00BTIDW4S,Well written story about different kind of people.  Think &#34;Mr. Spock of Star Trek&#34; and changleings (shape shifters).  In the series this book is #1.  The series can be read either in the &#34;timeline&#34; order or mixed up.  They are a stand alone.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Storyline was quite typical and a bit predictable for this genre, but was an easy read, so 3 stars. Quick thrill",3
B00BTIDW4S,"a very good free book. well written and edited. occasionally gets predictable, but then a twist pulls it back. definitely recommend.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"As with all of the other books in this series, it keeps you turning the pages. Very interesting & you can't help but fall in love with the characters. The fact that you can read them independently from the other books or in order only makes them all the better. I love Nicky Charles & have yet to read any I don't like.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I am loving all of her books. And I am just getting started. I'm already falling for Kane and Ryne. I'm excited to read the next one. If you love werewolves, you'll Law of the Lycans.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Loved this book as well. The author keeps you in suspense. I had a hard time putting the book down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I liked this story so much I went back to download the next one immediately. I can't wait to start it!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I read over some of these reviews for this book and I really can't believe some of the comments...rape? Seriously? It was consensual, from beginning, middle, until the end. Elise and Kane's story continues through into the other books, and it's obvious they couldn't be happier. For Elise, in the beginning everything was new and confusing and it all happened very fast to her. Kane was a gentleman and continued to be throughout the story, and it was no surprise she fell in love with him as quickly as she did. I love this series, all the characters are well rounded and the storyline is amazing, The author does a wonderful job transitioning into each book. There is nothing I would change about this book, you never know what's really going to happen, and I like that about these books, that it keeps you wondering how everything will turn out.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Flat one dimensional undeveloped characters and a rather boneless weak main female. The plot has such potential but falls short due to the lack of work on the characters. If you can get past that or don't care then you'd like the book. Also, if you are one of those readers who can't stomach rape then I'd suggest finding another author.",1
B00BTIDW4S,"I love this whole series, this being the third time I've read this book! Nicky did an awesome job storytelling and I definitely recommend it.",5
B00BTIDW4S,The book was amazing I couldn't put it down even after my kindle died I went to my computer and pulled  it up,5
B00BTIDW4S,"After reading some of the 1-2 star reviews, I have to wonder if people really understand what fiction means.I read the 1st book yesterday, and the 2nd today. I was just that into them. I liked the characters, and the story line and look forward to the next book",5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed the entire series.  Following the series of the Lycans by Mr Charles was very enjoyable from book 1 through the end,5
B00BTIDW4S,"It's different, fresh, and moving. I loved the whole thing....not a bad thing about it. A great free choice and definitely reading the others. Thank you Nicky Charles for something new and sexy.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Great book I really enjoyed reading this book Elsie and Kane love story really had me were I did not want to put the book down,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I mentioned this book to my daughter who said she has some of the other books that are parts to the story line. However, there is no mention of this anywhere else. I found the book itself very interesting and I can see how it  can be linked to other story lines.",4
B00BTIDW4S,well done Nicky. i will look out for more of your books. very engaging cannot wait for the next series,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really loved the great story in this book.  I could not put it down till I finished reading it.  What a beautiful story.Thank you so very much for writing it.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles has done it again. I loved this book so much as for the prequel! The suspense we obviously but it still had a surprise to it I gues. I was very satisfied that both of the characters were very loving and intimate despite the problems. But I just didn't like how she would get over things very easily when she gets mad. (Spoiler i guess not much though) You'll know what I mean when you read this book. But all in all I loved this book very much. You're doing a great job Nicky Charles!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating starts out with an interesting premise: in order to secure a political alliance among different packs and to ensure a larger roaming area the last remaining daughter of one pack (Elise) is married to the new Alpha of a nearby pack (Kane).  Proof of their first night of marriage is reviewed in the same way people did in the Dark Ages - checking for blood on the sheets.  Thus begins a story of an arranged marriage that soon spirals into environmental issues, land grabs, a fight for power, and jealous lovers.The story premise began with promise.  Who doesn't love to see a hero and heroine thrown together due to circumstances but eventually fall in love?  I love a good paranormal romance, and Ms. Charles does a good job of explaining the rush of animalistic instinct in the change from human to wolf.  There are also interesting tidbits about their past that drew me in: the death of Elise's mother after being caught in a trap and the subsequent withdrawal of her father and Kane's need to find a place to call home.  The external plot twist about the issues surrounding their land also added depth to the story.Yet the story fails in several respects.1) As other readers have noted, Elise isn't the brightest tool in the shed.  There were certain points where I was surprised at just how dumb she was.  Readers are smart and I didn't need her to catalog all of her clues in solving some of the mysteries in the story.  Ms. Charles (through Elise) gave us a laundry list of everything that had happened in the last few chapters as though we weren't paying attention; as though she thought we were as dumb as Elise.  Her ""naive"" questions could be brushed off as young (she's only 19 years old) but her blatant lack of understanding of communication with her husband makes me wonder if she isn't just self-absorbed and/or plain stupid.  There were several chapters that could have been omitted if she had just had a conversation with her husband.2) Kane's POV came much, much too late.  I kept waiting for a chapter from Kane's voice.  I wanted to know what he was thinking about bringing home some young woman from another pack.  What was going through his head?  What really makes this guy tick?  But I waited in vain until way late into the novel (last third) before Kane's voice finally appeared.  I cheered, happy that I finally got to dig into his head a little.  Yet it was too little, too late.3) The backstory and external conflict begged for more. I wanted to know more about how Kane and Elise's past affected them.  The past added a new dimension to the story in the beginning yet it was lost halfway through the book.  We never really got to see how Elise's mother's death affected her relationship with Kane.  We never got to hear Kane's story until our focus was already driven to the villain and the H/H's victory.  The ending felt like a mad dash to the finish where the story lost much of the richness that it had in the first third.4) Finally, call me practical, but I wanted to know how these people survive in the harsh human world.  Where is this money coming from?  What do these people do for a living?  The one person that was apparently in university was the ""smart one.""  Does that mean the rest of these people/werewolves were drop-outs?  Just one or two lines could have brought it all together.  And the story needed it - especially as money became an issue with solving the problems encountered by the characters.3.5 of 5 stars but I rounded down due to the issues above.  It's still an okay story and a fast read.  The writing was decent with a few errors here and there.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this book. It's a great romance. Beautiful characters, great story and wonderful setting. It gets an A+++ .",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love paranormal romances and this book did NOT disappoint! Easy read, not too long! Go check out the rest of the series!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"So I looked online to find the reading order of this series and it is a bit strange, but I went with it. I was surprised this book seems to have nothing to do with The Bonding. Characters don't mix no intertwined stories ... yet I really enjoyed both The Bonding and The Mating. Look forward to the next.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I didn't think I would like it at first, but ended up loving it. There were a few parts i was able to slightly predict, but was still pleasantly surprised by the ending and how the plot turned out. Definitely worth reading, especially since i got it for free.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"What it's about: This is also the first book in a series, the Law of the Lycans, and at first I wasn't sure I'd like it. The plot, basically: Elise is forced to mate with an alpha of another pack for political alliances. She always wanted to mate her best friend, and now she's going to do the deed with a stranger. No, this isn't how my favorite romances start out. What I didn't expect, though, was to like Kane so much (the alpha) or root for both of them as they figure out their new lives and the pack dynamics.Why you should download it: I have to say this is by far one of the best freebies I've ever read, and the plot was surprisingly deep. I enjoyed the push-and-pull dynamics between the two lovers and also the pack. I also think the rest of the series is free, so it's definitely worth checking out. While some of the scenes were repetitive, you can't ask for more for free. You have steam, you have a slow-building relationship and love, and you have the growing friendship and trust.Best kindle freebie right now!To see more free kindle books check out USA Today's HEA Blog",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is the first of the Lycon serries that introduces us to Nicky Charle's world of werewolves.  She writes well with good pace and interesting story line.  Don't be fooled by the price- you definitely get more than your money's worth on these stories.Note- there is strong sexual content involved in all of her books,5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a very thought out book. The characters were lifelike and for the most part believable. The friend/girlfriend went on a bit too much and I would have rather seen more of the brothers relationship being fixed. Overall a great read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This series was recommended by two friends.  I did enjoy The Mating.  The first few chapters drew me in and I found I couldn't stop reading this book.  At first I thought Bane was overbearing but by the end I found he was caring and understanding to Elise's confusion at being in a new pack.  I liked Elise because she was confused by her new life but stayed true to herself by insisting on a life outside the pack, no matter how small that was.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I don't care about throbbing thighs sex scenes. They can be fun. BUT having them be non-consensual moves it into rape territory and is encouraging others to believe non-consensual sex is not rape if the person being raped has an orgasm.Sorry, but rape is rape.The story could be so much better if the characters took the time to interact beyond forcing sex on the females.  As it is, I can not give it a positive recommendation.",1
B00BTIDW4S,What a pleasant surprise! Not only was this a free read but it was a fantastic story and well written! The odds of that combo are pretty slim. This book has everything a werewolf story needs to be exiting and fun. The characters were all endearing and the plot twist were page tuners! Will read again. That is my highest complement to an author.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a great story! Kane & Elise where perfect. I am glad that I did not allow the negitive reviews sway me away. My only constructive feedback is; its in Elise point of view. I wish we had more thoughts from Kane. Looking forward to the series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I dislike having to write the 20 word limit on a great book. I'd rather let the purchaser know I loved it and this author is a must read.I give Nicky Charles 5 stars for her writing and storytelling. They are compelling and hard to put down. I've read them all. You won't be disappointed.Great to know Nicky is receiving money for her work. She deserves it.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Great sex and nice storyline. Hard to put this story down. I would recommend this book to my friends. This is as good as it gets,great read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Excellent way to relax in and understand the way to relax on the wild side of life by letting your inner animal loose. Nicky Charles has done an excellent job of bringing the characters to life along with the adventures they have both in their private and pack lives. JADOYLE,5
B00BTIDW4S,I liked the continuing story line and wished I had read them in sequence.  Will read more of Charles' books when available.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love all of Nicky Charles' novels, this one was the first I read. Started out a little slow, but rapidly gained momentum and you can tell she thinks her plots and twists through completely before publishing. Wonderful job, Nicky!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This book will have you falling for the alpha male. Kane will have you wanting more of his  alpha wolf,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The mating was a bit of a nice surprise. I thought this would be another shifter series like all the others, but I was wrong.  This was a story about the were wolf gene that was very different in it's rendering.I love the old fashion idea of the virgin bride who had to be proved with the blood stained sheets.  It's not the common story line for this type of story.  Most of them have had a bit of mileage before meeting their sole mate.  This one was an arranged mating that was initiated for the good of the pack.That it turned in a hot, lusty, sweaty,  crank up the temperature story only added to it's appeal.I love it and I think those who like this type of story will agree.Read, and Enjoy",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have read all of the Nicky Charles Lycan Series books except one and they have me hooked. She is fantastic with the interaction of characters and each book pics up where the other left off. The characters are easy to keep track of and she is just great about keeping you interested in the series. Cannot get enough of these. She just started charging for the one I am reading now, but I can honestly say I  would have paid more.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I read it on smashwords and loved it. I have nothing bad to say about this book other then I felt the characters didn't spend much time together in a room other than that it was still a good read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Great story line!Having a dysfunctional early family life made this story very believable. Marla was the perfect bad guy. Wanting what she couldn't get and ruining everybodies lifes to try and achieve it.Will definitely look for more from this author.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I was referred to Nicky Taylor from a co-worker, and am so glad I tried this book out. It was not only free, but a really, really good story. Loved the characters and how the whole story came together. I literally couldn't put it down. It's nice that you can take your Kindle with you everywhere. I wouldn't have changed anything about the story. We have both finished this one and started immediately on The Keeping. Great work Nicky Taylor.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"While I enjoyed this story and didn't quite expect the twist at the end, I felt the heroine was a little too dim for her own good. I sure hope she shows some glimmer of intelligence through the rest of the series. She has lots of inner monologue going, and if she just does something, instead of standing there twiddling her thumbs, she would be a more likable heroine. I don't like that she acts on assumptions. It doesn't make for a good story. It was the supporting characters that made this a good read.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I was not sure that I would like this book but was happily surprised and read the whole thing in almost one sitting. If I have thing to complain about it would be that it was not a series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"the ultimate pre-arranged marriage. Kane and Elise make an amazing team, once they stop fighting it.This was a really good story giving Nicky's perspective of how a pack functions. The established hierarchy, passing down of leadership, and the kindness and tenderness extended to leaders past their prime. Throw in the bad girl(s), and the high speed chase through the woods...another great ride.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"A friend of mine told me about this series. She thought I might like the books and she told me they were free. Bonus! I wasn't sure about the arranged mating, but as it turned out I l really liked this book. I have read all of the books in this series, so I must say this is probably my least favorite, so way to go Nicky!",4
B00BTIDW4S,Great book could not keep from reading it in its entirety..surprised that it was free. Can't wait to read the next!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Okay now where to begin.... This book, was the hardest to put down, that I have ever read!! WOW!!  Nicky Charles is an absolutely wonderful author, I am very excited to read future writings!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"WHEN I GOT THIS DOWNLOAD I DIDNT KNOW IT WAS ABOUT A DOG MATING AND BEING A DOG LOVER I COULDNT READ IT I STILL HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE BUT I DONT LIKE TO READ ABOUT PETS, SO IT MAY BE GOOD BUT I HAVENT READ IT JUST INCASE IT HAS A UNHAPPY ENDING",2
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this book, and hoping there is more to the stories.The interaction between the characters was great, as well as the little plot twists added in to it.The sex scenes were pretty steamy too.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I was not expecting to enjoy this so much when I started it. Once I started it was impossible for me to stop because I became so wrapped up in what might happen next. The characters were really great and made me care about what was going on and how they would react to what I already knew. The plot was simple and yet still complex enough to keep you turning the pages as the action played out. I had never read anything by Nicky Charles but can see why so many people have said such good things about these books, they are able to really take you away.The story starts out simply with a girl, Elise, being informed that she will be mated to a man that she has never met. While she is less than happy about it, because she thinks herself already in love, she would never think of not doing it. Her intended, Kane, has agreed to mate her because he is an Alpha and it is time he started a family. Elise must leave home and start life in unfamiliar territory, with people she does not know and there are things going on which she cannot understand within this new group. Things which could be dangerous to her and those around her.I started not liking Elise because she seemed so whiny and childish, and I really hate whiny people, but she came around and grew a backbone. Kane I liked from the beginning because he sounded impossibly hot but also understanding and sweet. The rest of the people around him were well drawn out and I ended liking all of them except for Marla who was a snake and written just as well. Nothing like having someone to really dislike in a story, makes it more interesting and fun.I suggest reading this book and the rest just like I plan to do!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have read all of Nicky Charles books. They are great.I loved all the characters the alpha males, the adoring but strong partners and the villians. These books are a great read, I suggest you read them all. This is such a generous author offering her work for such a bargain. These stories are fairly long. A great Read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this set of book. I will definitely look for other books written by this author. It stayed true to its character from book to book. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Highly recommend.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I found it to be a very suspenseful paranormal read. The characters were fun and exciting, I would definitely recommend this book series.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"The book started off slow than around the middle of the book,it start getting very interested. I love how we start trusting Marla and rose was a bigger surprise,but I knew some how Marla was still a trip and tune wow I hope he have a book and get him a good mate I love love this book!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"NTM author so decided to try THE MATING back in 2010. I think that this book may appeal more to YA/NA readers or those just starting to read PNR.Not too bad for a free read, but I didn't find it particularly romantic or suspenseful. Main characters were a bit on the bland side and cardboard-ish and IMO, their romantic relationship was developed rather awkwardly. The plot became very predictable, with little guessing as to the ""baddies"".  And unfortunately, I had a huge eyeroll moment towards the end.Still, there was enough in this author's writing that I may read another book to see if the subsequent books are stronger.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"Im giving a brief review of books one thru three. I have to admit I felt book one in this series was just okay- I felt there was something lacking between the romantic characters and that hurt the story a bit. I did think  the story had some really good elements, was still interesting and the second book was free so I read on.  The second book was so much better! The writer found her groove I guess because there was so much improvement in character development in the second and third books, I loved em.  Great fun read and I hope there will be more! Can't believe I enjoyed a free series so much.(Spoiler) to the writer: in the second book I was really mad that Lucy was killed off! Really liked her character!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"New story line that I enjoyed. Some grammar issues throughout with spelling errors, but a good story nonetheless. I am ready to read the next story in the series.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Easy and fun read that keeps the reader fully engaged from cover to cover. Can.`t wait to begin the next book in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really did not like anything about this book and I ended up not being able to even finish it.  Reading Junkie says it all in their review!,1
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a continued story from the  the book I just read. The Bonded. A story about two brothers that want control over their pack.Falling in love, trying to move on. Lots of adventure. I would pass this on to my friends.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I thought this story was very well done and the characters were likeable too. It had action, mystery, steamy romance and mayhem.  I love a good werewolf story.  The story just drew me in and it was hard to put down.  I hope there will be a book II.  After all....the ""BAD"" wolf is still out there!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a great book. The blend of human and wolf characteristics was done very well. Made me wonder if there's any weres living around us, but we just don't know it. Looking forward to the next book in the series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book.  I found it very fast paced and entertaining.  I got involved with the characters and was therefore frustrated when things didn't go the way I wanted them to!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"If you are into werewolves then you'll like this book. It's a good ""love story"". I'm just glad my life doesn't have as much drama as this story! Getting ready to read the sequel right now.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Love, sex, aggression, humor,  suspense, family, wolves. Really a joy to read. Prequel was good and I looked forward to this one. Can't wait to read next book. Thanks.  4 stars.",3
B00BTIDW4S,This book is definitely a good read. I am definitely recommending this book to everyone who has a Kindle. It is a must-read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved the story line, the characters were great. The one problem I had was every time I turned the page words were missing, there would be a sentence on one page and then a completely different sentence on the next. But good book overall.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Really liked the story line and how it evolved. Gave information at all the right times to add to the story. The sex scenes are not overly done and obnoxious but more tasteful than what I expected.Glad I was able to get all 4 books in this to read. I cannot wait to see what else is in store for the characters.,5
B00BTIDW4S,It was one of the very few books ina lifetime of reading that I could not finish.Did not like the the correlation between animal and human.,1
B00BTIDW4S,2nd book in the series. a young girl is set up in a arrange marriage and tries to make it work. she moves away from her family and friend to a new area. the husband is a alpha/boss of the pack/family. his pack is going threw a brake down in the ranks in his pack/family. she is set up to take the fall. if you want to know what happens next read the book. the first book does not have to be read first in the series for this book to make scenes.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I have enjoyed reading this book. Nicky Charles has written a wonderful werewolf story, full of deceit, turmoil and the sometimes savage life of a werewolf. I would read more from this author.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I was surprised cuz I'm more of a vamp paranormal girl but the first chapter sucked me in. I loved that the bad guy was a girl. Can't wait till the next book is out,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I'm so glad to be reading these books! I can't wait to read them all. Great story, love the characters.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I normally don't read supernatural books, but this one left me ready to eat the next. Can't wait to read what's in store for Ryne, Bryan, & Daniel.....",4
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed reading The Mating. I can't wait to read the next book in this serious. I would recommend this serious by Nicky Charles to anyone interested in a great paranormal romance.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Well written and grabs hold of the reader right from the start.  Hope she will continue to write more books.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this series.  Got this book because it was free then bought the rest of the series.  Page turner for sure.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This is not the first or second time I have read this book. The people in this story were wonderful and the story kept you glued to the pages!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The writer does an excellent job pulling you into her dynamic characters in this exhilarating story. This book offers romance, action and mystery.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Google Nicky Charles and find out the sequence of the series.  they are a must read for anyone who like the far out, can it really be happening somewhere in the world story....",5
B00BTIDW4S,"If you like reading about Lycanthropes you won't be sorry with this story, there is plenty of character development and steamy romance :)  I was disappointed with how a few of the characters were so quick to judge and make assumptions....but I suppose that is life, and especially story-book life where it is an easy source of conflict.  Ms. Charles certainly kept me guessing until the end as to who was really at the heart of the problems with this book and I wasn't disappointed in the end. Just finished this book and can't wait to start the next one...I have 2 more days off and anticipate not doing much else!!  Thanks so much, Nicky Charles, for a very enjoyable read!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Another good drama from Nicky Charles .with the right amount of mystery and suspense. It did Not seem as long but perhaps because it moved right along.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"...another hold your breath and hang on for a roller coaster ride if you want to read a story thAt will make you smile, cry, gasp, shudder get angry feel awe, remind you of your first love and your first discovery of adult life.  Thank you Nicky Charles....a GOOD YARN",5
B00BTIDW4S,classic exciting middle book to the 3 book series. I hope the author writes more. Donated to Humane society on behalf of all books 50$,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I am in the last leg of this series and took the time to read a lot of reviews including the bad one. I am glad I did because sometimes people review without really thinking of the whole picture. Some think Elise is nave, and stupid and pretty much swiped the floor with her. Well, I bed to differ. Yes, she is nave but how else can she be. She is a powerful Alpha&#8217;s daughter, 19, and has lived a shelter life.  So yes, Marla tricked her, but she tricked even the big ol&#8217; Alphas too. However, at the end she is the one that rose above all and ID the bad guy and fought for what those she loves. It cannot get any stronger under her particular circumstances. Anyway, I love the story, yes Kane did something he shouldn&#8217;t have but he owns it and feels horrible about it. Kane is soooo good and yummy.  I enjoyed the entire series and invite you to go in this little adventure with Ms. Charles.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I have read this book three times.  I loved it.  I wasn't sure I would but I did.  I have the books that came along after this.  Good work Nicky.  Good work.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I have the final book of this series to read. I truly hope she writes more of this series. These books are great reads.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked the characterizations, even though the main character, Elise, was way to trusting.  And her mate was really dumb when it came to understanding females.  Other than that, the plot was good. The pace was fast and it had a good ending.  What more can you want with a first book.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoy paranormal, but I tend to shy away from werewolf type reads because they are usually have a bit too much gore for my taste. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this was written, how thoroughly the characters were developed and how well thought out the plot was. Good stuff!",4
B00BTIDW4S,it's not great but it's not bad either...it's just OK. There are some lull moments to it so I just breezed through some of the pages. The theme was good though and there's a touch of suspense as well plus it has a good ending for the lead couple. So it's still OK for me.,3
B00BTIDW4S,the action. the drama. and the love and companionship. the best. Looking forward to the next book. hope ryne finds his mate. what's she gonna be like?,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was my first book I've ever read on my kindle. I cannot even tell you how many times I have read this book. I love love love Kane and Elise, one of my favorites. I have read all Nicky's other books and hope someday soon she will come out with some more. Please Nicky, I'm ready!",5
B00BTIDW4S,ths entirely different from what I thought it would be. the more I read the better  it got. it was hard to put down. I am planning to read the books from this author. please keep on writing. it was different from anything I have ever. read. thank you.,4
B00BTIDW4S,This series is fabulous....Nicky Charles definitely one of my favorite paranormal authors haven't read one story yet I didn't fall in love with,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book; I downloaded all 3 and just found the 4th one.  All I can say is I'll be downloading the 5th as soon as I hear it is out.  Kane is soo hot in this book but you have to keep and eye out for his older brother ...book 2 is just has hot as book one.  There's nothing sexier than a man on all fours.Ann Wilson ...Paranormal Romance,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This story like the others are the best. It has a great concept and wonderful characters. Although they are wolves, the human side is so entertaining. I really appreciate the stories intertwining with one another. You get to learn all the characters and see everyone as their stories unwind.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I actually read the 4th book (i think) before this one since I thought with it labelled &#34;pre-quel&#34; I should read it first.  Really didn't matter or screw up the storyline, it's just that good!  Loved the story, the characters were fantastic and I enjoyed how each book had references to the characters from the other books here and there.  LOVED IT!!!  Also couldn't believe the author was providing them for free.  Don't forget to support those less fortunate - The humane society can use all the support they can get for those cute dogs & cats :)",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have read the other 2 books in the series that take place before this one and I can see where the writing has improved. That being said there could be tighter editing - the book need not have been so long and there was an element of repetition of thoughts and events that slowed the flow of the story. One of the aspects of the story that was a little unnerving was the forcing of the the main female protagonist into a ""mating""against her will. It reminded me of the child brides in the Middle East and Asian countries who are married to older men for money and alliances just like this story. They also do not know their spouses and have to move away from their home and family right away. I liked the main characters and would recommend this book with a caution about the elements mentioned above. The novel moved the overall story forward and set up elements for future books.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"The beginning had a bit of slowness for a few pages, then it just went spinning forward. You could relate to Elise and at times hate Kane, the plot was there leaving you guessing. With the ending just shocking, I never saw it coming! I will be keeping my eye out for more of this Authors books and looking forward to more great shifter reads!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"What can I say?  Read the title and you have a hint as to what this is all about.  Basically, another aspect of life as a werewolf.  What could be better than some good old fashioned sex?  It never gets overly involved withe sex itself but remains a part of the story.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Not to bad .it was a full length novel and the plot works .ok sex and drama Will read the next story.,3
B00BTIDW4S,A very entertaining read... sexually yummy... can't think of a better way to spend a rainy day.. May  your collection grow and grow. I will be watching for more.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good book. There was a lot of twist and turns and  made you want to hurry up so you could find out was was going to happen next.  A good and fast read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I read it non stop without a book break so this deserves 5 stars if I was able to stay this captivated. I'm assuming there is a sequel with a couple of the main characters story unfinished.The sex scenes were extremely erotic and was quite impressive how well they were written without any x-rated words incorporated into the scenes.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was my first shapshifter novel and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it.  The writing was a bit tedious at times and some phrases were repeated ad nauseum  (eg.&#34;You are my Mate&#34; ) but aside from that I enjoyed the vernacular, theme and journeying through an alternative/paranormal lifestyle.  After reading, I downloaded the other four books and spent my off time from work catching up on the world of werewolves.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Characters: I loved these characters and this story the best so far.  Elise was a great character that grew up a lot in this story as she becomes mated to an alpha and moves into his pack.  Kane was swoonworthy with his bad boy traits and his compassionate nature.  Loved him!  These are just two of the fabulous characters Nicky Charles makes up in her series and no two are ever alike.Writing Style: Nicky Charles always starts out the first chapter with a bang and in The Mating, it was no different.  Forced to leave her boyfriend to be mated with a mysterious Alpha from another pack made this one of the best openings I have read in a while.  While I do find Nicky Charles' writing too tedious at times because it is repetitive, I really love her story lines and her characters.Plot: Kane's pack has had a series of bad luck incidents that have caused strife within the ranks.  First the alpha dies in an auto accident, and then Kane is challenged by his own brother Ryne to be the next Alpha.  Kane wins and Ryne slinks off under suspicion of wanting to hurt the pack.  Marla, Ryne's girlfriend has turned her sights on Kane despite his new marriage and her deceptiveness causes harm to everyone.  Also, an oil company is looking to take their land and some of the pack wants to sell to them and become rich.Romance: IS WHY I READ and this one had a lot of sensual moments that were fun to read.  The Mating had several really good love scenes and, WOW, werewolves are very sensuous! I love this series and feel fortunate for having got it for free.  Nicky Charles is talented - now just get some new COVERS!Sex and Violence Rating: R - Descriptive Sex, not much Swearing, Some killing5 Stars - It was a Good but needs to be edited, Got the free sequel Already!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to admit that when this book popped up in my recommendations, I was skeptical because it was free and the past free stories I've read were not good. This one however was amazing. I enjoyed the story from start to finish and who we n it ended I wanted more. Although I really enjoyed this book, I did have one issue with it. It was super obvious who the culprit behind every thing was and I wanted to shake Elise every time as she just brushed her suspicions aside, like come on really? And there were like 3 parts in the story where like a few paragraphs seemed to be missing. But other than that, great story and I look forward to reading more of your work!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I like dabbling in the free books.  This proved to be a great story overall and I really connected to the Alpha and his mate.  Some of it had slow spots but read it in one sitting.  Download it!,4
B00BTIDW4S,Great read!I really enjoyed it and am really looking forward to reading more books by Nicky Charles! Starting the next one tonight!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Have I mentioned that I love this series? It's awesome and the characters are awesome! I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to read more! I will most likely re read the series again, and I rarely do that! Great book!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Book was good but why was the heroine was gullible.  Elise was unsure of herself which seems more like a teenager character not a woman.  I hope in future books she becomes a more well rounded character not so sheltered or naive. Also her mind is wondering while a gun is being pointed at her?  Really.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"The original mating was only for political alliances, but as they grew to be in each others company so did their hearts for each other. Even though Kane showed her affection early in the story after they mated, he pulled her close to him as she was silently crying. Elise was making me angry by not piecing together situations early about Marla's sneaky ass. And I must say even though he was in this book briefly I Love Me some Ryne.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I read Bonded, then this one, I enjoyed Bonded more because it had more from both sides unlike this one did. Up untill the end all you read ways from her side, finally from his at the end. Most of the action was at the end so for me, it was a bit slow going in the middle of the book, but still interesting. I enjoyed it alot and can't wait for Raynes story next.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I didn't necessarily dislike this book, but I didn't love it enough give it five stars either, and let me tell you all why. This book was like watching a train wreck and not being able to look away. It was predictable, but I still couldn't help turning the pages out of sheer curiosity just to see if the villain would finally get what she deserved.A word of friendly advice...if you are someone like me then you want to read about the really, really nasty alpha male werewolves I suggest reading Kristen Ashley's ""With Everything I Am"", or Eva Langlais's ""His Teddy Bear."" The people who HAVEN'T read either of those can thank me for the advice on that later.Now back to this book...Where do I begin? I don't know there's so much to like and dislike about this book....First of all, I had to deduct some points because I caught myself skimming a lot just to get to the good parts. Secondly, the sex scenes between Kane and Elise didn't bother me as much as it did others, obviously. Elise was in a rough position, either abide by the ways and laws of her people, or in this case, obey the alpha wolf, or face the consequences and possibly be ostracized from the only home and family she's ever known. Therefore, Elise was in a situation that she had no control over which I totally got. Furthermore, in my own opinion, just to be fair, I don't really think their first encounter could be considered rape because she only said ""no"" after he breached her maiden's veil and she felt the pain which happens with virgins, but after the pain subsided she actually enjoyed what she was getting so much that she also got it twice more before the next day. However, what did bother me is Kane's blatant disregard for his new mate. I mean, he takes her away from everything she's ever known and leaves her to fend for herself. I know they were strangers when they met and mated but she deserved so much better from him. It felt like she was being used just as a warm body in order keep his sexual urges sated and nothing more. Kane just sleeps with her, disappears, and ignores her for obscene lengths of time. Other times he was just nonchalant and dismissive. I started to feel bad for Elise because she was just stuck having to deal with a new pack, fit into her new home with strangers, adapt to her new surroundings, make new friends, and learn how to roam new territory all on her own. Kane hardly made an effort to help her adjust to any of this, after he uprooted her from her life without her having any say-so in the matter, everything was just right back to business for him.Wait...it gets worse!The way her ""mate"" disrespects her by letting Marla walk all over her was just infuriating. I have never read a book where the alpha male was so stupid and so easily manipulated by a woman in my life. EVER. Marla played Kane like a fiddle, and Elise kept her mouth shut and tried to deal with him constantly putting another woman first. Say whaaat...Wait...I'm just getting warmed up!Despite her best efforts, Elise, kept trying to be a good mate by not complaining and proving what a strong woman she could be, but she came across as a doormat so many times because whenever she had a real problem with something, or in this case, someone, she wouldn't speak her mind. I know she meant well, and she actually tried dealing with a lot of this stuff on her own to her credit, but I wanted her to tell Kane just once to pull his head out of his rear end when it came to Marla. I get tired of reading books where these women constantly take crap from these alphas. There's nothing wrong with being submissive to the more dominant sex or species, but if he's being unreasonable then is should also be her job as his mate to let him know when he's being a complete @sshole.All in all, Elise doesn't get her apology from Kane for the set-up, but Kane does redeem himself quite a bit in my opinion. I know I have been really critical, but I really liked this book. Don't get me wrong, this book started out very slowly for me, but the ending was worth it so I'm glad I hung in there.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I love it!  I held my attention and kept my interest.  I couldn't leave it alone for long.Great pool book,5
B00BTIDW4S,"If you're really into romance then this is for you.  I expected more of this book because it's about packs of wolves and their problems with the humans, territories, government and that kinda thing.  But it really didn't get too much into that; and I'll be honest with you as I got to (over) 60% of the book and just gave up.  Don't get me wrong as I like romance in my stories but this didn't touch enough about the wolfs. To me the story was just flat.  thx!",2
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was a good read.  It was not my favorite, but good.  I think it was a little drawn out. The author could of wrote the story without dragging out every moment. However, since the book was free, it's hard to complain to much. I'm actually going to read another one of her books.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I've now read all of the books in this series. What I first want to say applies to all of the books in the series (so am putting it in all of my reviews). I had to go to the author's website to try and figure out the best order to read them in. In the end, I went with chronological order: Bonded, The Mating, The Keeping, Betrayed, then The Finding. Overall, I think the stories were interesting. Clearly, if I didn't like them I wouldn't have continued to read the entire series. I was prompted to read them in the first place because of the good reviews and the price (can't beat FREE)! However, I can only give them 3 stars because they were so overly redundant I found myself skipping over a great deal and wanting to get straight to the point. I think they could have each been shortened by 30+ pages without losing anything of value. Many things were unnecessarily repeated and actually took away from the plot development. The author did a good job developing her characters and the storyline, so there was no need to repeat things over and over again. I'm thinking specifically of how she may have told a story about something that happened in a character's past multiple times throughout the text. If you told it once, you can just reference it or put a one liner in that will prompt the reader to remember. I felt she didn't give the readers enough credit to put things together or their own or connect the dots. Everything was explained in great detail too many times and some of the stories felt dragged out. Still, I was drawn into the stories and connected with the characters (hence the 3 stars). As other reviewers have said, these books are available free elsewhere if Amazon is charging for them!The Mating wasn't my favorite of the series, but was an easy and enjoyable enough book. Elise's character was different from the werewolves introduced in the first series, but her naivety and strength were well developed. While this book wasn't as redundant as Bonded, it was still a bit dragged out. I also would have liked to see some more of Kane's past from his days at the Academy brought into the mix. This book also contrasts the first in the series, Bonded, by being so sexist and ""traditional"" with woman's roles in the pack. I personally relate to a more independent main character, and while Elise was strong in her own ways, she was still very docile. If I had read this book first I would have been under the impression that this way of life was the norm for all female werewolves in the series, which is certainly not the case. It contributes to the overall series, but as a standalone novel leaves a lot to be desired.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"It was a good read. There were some parts that I thought were unnecessary, but I could see why the author put them in. I wish that the Marla character could have been killed out of the book instead of leaving that open to interpretation.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in paranormal books.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Wow that was a amazing book. I highly suggest this book for any one who likes mystery and werewolf books. I enjoy both but together it's like caramel and ice cream.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I liked the story and the characters enough to want to read all of the books.  I add Nicky Charles to my list of favorite authors/storytellers!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Read this book I don't care what other people say about its one of the best books I have read. And I have read a lot of them. The story was right on the mark, adventure romance sex fighting you name it it's there.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved the authors writing style. The characters seemed to come to life. I couldn't put it down. Love it!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a favorite of mine and I have read it twice. I was worried about posting this review because I was told this was a pirated book. I am not sure if it really is but the story is too good for me not to post a review about it. If it is pirated, it is a shame  because the author should be proud of the book. The story is wonderful, the characters are well developed and I could not put it down. I will look into the legitimacy of it being pirated but still feel the story is worth a 5 out of 5 rating.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Enjoyed the story line and characters. This is my first read from Nicky and I'm looking forward to the next book?,4
B00BTIDW4S,Those characters in this Lucian story were great . The reader will stay enthralled. The story has a good plot that was creative and exciting. I would recommend every reader try this story.Bahamascancer@yahoo,4
B00BTIDW4S,the mating is a great read if you love werewolves you will really get in to this book. it kept me on my toes all the way to the end.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THESE BUT IT REALLY CAPTURED MY ATTENTION, TILL I HAD TO READ THE WHOLE SERIES",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I chose this rating, because while I enjoyed the story a lot, I wished it were longer. It seemed like the author was rushing things a little. The story was fun though & I liked the way questions the reader had were handled creatively. I'll definitely get the sequel.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this book. I loved how the author took the time to develop the relationships of the characters. It really allowed the reader to connect to them. I read this through in one sitting. Which was awesome because it was a full length story. One of the better wolf stories out there.,4
B00BTIDW4S,If you like werewolf theme books this is for you! This series is great and I am looking forward to the next one!,4
B00BTIDW4S,This was an amazing story! I enjoyed every minute of it. I had a hard time putting it down. Fantastic story! I will definitely read more by this author.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Another great Nicky Charles book.  I have loved this series.  Easy book to pick up and just keep reading it until the end. If you havent read the other books, I highly recommend you do - the stories all link to one another.",5
B00BTIDW4S,It was very good.  Had action romance and suspense... I didn't like some of the things that the characters did but a good book is supposed to get a reaction out of you.  The characters even see real and needless to say this book had a great plot development.  Best o  all it was over 100 pages a good long story.  It is very difficult to get a good romance novel with a significant amount of pages.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a bad book on so many levels. I am absolutely shocked at the high ratings.Let's start with the factual/giant plot holes. An oil company cannot force you to let them drill on your land if you also own the mineral rights. The pack has owned this land for over a hundred years and they were supposedly going to be forced into signing a lease. They are out in the middle of nowhere and probably the only mineral owner out there. This is a completely made-up boogey man.Second, just how big is the pack and nearby town? Seriously no one notices that the slick red sports car that belonged to Ryne (the ""bad guy"") is now being driven around by Marla? Please.Third, exactly how big are the packs? Only about a dozen people are described, but they must be larger or everyone would be mating with their uncles and sisters.And that segues into the lack of description. The author describes the settings, characters and events in a very vague way. We don't know how big these packs are. Do the pack members regularly interact with outsiders? Do they ever date or befriend an outsider? More importantly, what happens when a werewolf shifts? The process is never described. Is it instantaneous or take time? How much energy does it take? Do they have to shift during a full moon?And lastly - the main character drove me up the wall. She's supposed to be the mate of the alpha and expects respect, but never actually does anything to earn it. She literally does nothing except mope around and whine. Her new mate is crazy busy with pack business. So what does she do to fill her time? She gets a part-time job in town. Umm, how about helping your mate with pack business instead? Maybe everyone would stop treating you like a stranger then too.She's just so weak and wishy-washy. She can't solve a problem to save her life and her sole existence seems to be geared towards creating mass confusion and misunderstandings. This is behavior I would expect from a Victorian romance, not a book about werewolves!",1
B00BTIDW4S,"I actually liked it a lot. It's a free e=book, that you can download from Amazon or Ibooks.It's paranormal romance, and I thought it would be a quick read, but it ended up being a good book.Eloise suddenly finds herself thrown in a marriage of convenience, since she is the daughter of an Alpa, and now marries the Alpha of another pack forming an alliance. She accepts her fate with her head held high, but it's very different from the future she saw herself.Now she is married to a man she doesn't know, lives in a house that isn't hers with three other people and in a land she's new in that has its own set of problems, that keep her new husband away.The intrigue of what is happening in the land, and of course there is always the big bad wolf, in this case its literally, the &#34;other&#34; woman interested in being the alphas wife, and the big company planing to buy land, are some of the thing Eloise has to deal with with.",4
B00BTIDW4S,What a world that has been created. Not only is it romantic but hot too. Add the on the edge of your seat story line and you can get lost in this world of the Laycans. This was a hard book to put down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This Book is a great read.I couldn't put it down I stayed up most of the night reading . I recommend this book to all readers.I love ed this book!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Delightful fun read, not all authors can pull you in as fast as Nicky Charles did in this book for me. I could relate to the characters in this book more so than any other book I have read in a long time. The characters were enjoyable and their story was so real. This was a good book. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series. Great storyteller.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book is one of the few free books that I absolutely LOVED reading and kept me up at night reading. Great storyline, depth of characters, you really felt like you were in the book! The paranormal part of it was described in depth, but not too much to bore you. Definitely recommend this book! I did not feel it was degrading to women in any part, its NONFICTION. get over it. There are plenty of other books out there that you can talk about ""rape"" Did not even enter my mind while reading.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"If never read books about werewolves ,vampires or such so I was surprised how much I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. Already have the sequel ready.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"It had been awhile since I read the first (which really turned out to be the 4th written in this series) book ""Bonded"" which I really enjoyed.  This one ""Mating"" not so much. It felt somewhat stereotypical with predictable action. But then I discovered this was her first written book of series so from that perspective it was still a very good story.  Just a little simplistic. I still enjoy following the characters knowing more books were coming but these two, Kane and Elise, did not really pull me into their story. Probably would not reread. But with that said I am still willing to follow this series.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"This story was well written, but the love story aspect would probably be enjoyed by someone younger (teens or tweeners). Some aspects of the &#34;mystery&#34; were pretty easy to foretell, but overall a good read.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"It started off well enough if you don't mind the circumstances but it fizzled out for me towards the middle and only picked up enough at the end for enjoy it. In all honesty I wanted to skip it but I didn't want to miss anything as I went on to the next book so I continued to read even though I was a bit bored. As I said, it did pick up towards the end and was a little more interesting so I was able to finish reading.In the previous 2 books the author made a point of allowing a certain amount of time to pass...weeks, months, even years. In this book everything happened in about the space of a month.In the beginning we find out that Elise is to be married to Kane because of political alliance between her father's pack and Kane's pack. That was just ridiculous the way it turned out. Elise literally had 3 hours before she was mated to Kane. In my opinion the author should have at least thrown a few days in the mix. It would just seem more logical and make more sense.Another thing I had issues with is the time between Elise believing she is in love with Bryan and the time she starts to realize she loves Kane. This is another reason why I have issues with the time sequence in this novel. We literally read day after day of what they do. While I can understand Elise assessing her feelings and seeing that Kane is who she is in love with instead of Bryan who she just loves I think a month or two should have been given.It might just be me but it was really annoying to be halfway through the book and only a week and a half passed and Elise is saying she might be in love with Kane. Also I don't mind that Elise really had no skills whatsoever but by her conversations with Kane you could tell she is smart and I found it stupid that she got so many clues about what was happening and was not able to connect the dots.I liked Kane. I think he is a good Alpha and besides the aggression at the end which which wasn't that bad since they basically wanted the same thing. He tried his hardest to make Elise happy and while he could have done things differently he did what he could.At the end....I didn't really like what went on between Ryne and Elise....it was insinuating in my opinion to some attraction. That could just be me again as it wasn't anything obvious. I honestly feel I am being a bit generous giving it  3 stars but there were parts of this book that were good but there was a lot wrong with it.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this book and thought  the author did a good job of creating the characters and the story.  I also found two other books by this author so I went ahead and added those to my library.  Hopefully they'll be as good as this one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Very well done Nicky Charles. I have found about 4 of these story line novels, hoope to find more. It's one of those &#34;you can&#34;t put it down novels&#34;",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Read this in one sitting. Fast-paced, with some surprises, sexy bedroom scenes, and great character development. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys the Werewolf Genre.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was unexpected book lots of emotions I read entire book in one day awesome free book I will find and read more from this author,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love book's about wolfs and shifters. So this was no different. Great story. Really glad I picked it up to read..,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book has it all.....intrigue, mystery, unrequited love, heartache and betrayal. The characters are well defined and the story line excellent. Nicky Charles hit a home run with ""The Mating"", and I am looking forward to the next book.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I did enjoy it but it was really needing more in regards to who the characters are. We were given the most detail about the female protagonist and I really felt even that was lacking. Decent story but it is hard to care when you don't know them.,3
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles has done a really fine job of this series, I love the characters in it, thanks so much",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Perfect book expanding the story drone the first book. Hard to say which book I liked best, the prequel or this book.Well written story plot with more mystery than it's predecessor. I love how the writer touched on this character in the first book but left you intrigued and your mind to wondering how they fit into the plot. With this book it gives you more insight and depth of his character.Another hard to put down book and must read",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is the another book in the Law of Lycans series and excellent.  Really enjoyed seeing the relationship grow and change.  The female protagonist was a real b++ch, in every sense of the word.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Ms. Charles did not disappoint with this book. This is my second read in the series and I am very pleased.The book has a lot of substance. There is a real storyline with action, intrigue, treachery, deceit and love.I enjoyed how the main characters evolved and the love that grew between them. Fantastic read!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I never read Nicky Charles' books before but after reading this one, I just got three more.  This book was such a fun, escapism book full of the love and passion, but also a good plot with twists enough to hold your interest.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Paranormal romance is not my usual genre.  That being said, I read first two books in this series and have enjoyed them both.  My one pet peeve with The Mating was the lack of communication between Elise and Kane.  So many things could have been avoided if only they had talked.  I know it would have made the story shorter but at times I was shaking my head at those two.  I still enjoyed the book more than I shook my head.  I can't wait to start the next story and see what happens.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Great addition to the Lucian series! The characters are deep and the story has romance and energy. I love the connection to family and the adventure. Bring on the next one!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to admit that the genre of paranormal romance had never appealed to me in the past.  In fact, I never finished one of ""those"" types of novels - until now.  Nicky Charles has crafted a well-rounded love story that touched my heart and I could not put it down!  The romance of Elise and Kane was rich, well developed, and emotionally satisfying.  Elise is a typical young female, secure in her place within her family unit, on the cusp of adulthood and its associated pleasures and responsibilities, looking forward to starting her life with her childhood best friend.  She exhibits many of the same uncertainties about her ability to function as a woman that I could relate to at the same age.  Kane overcomes a turbulent childhood that lacked stability and a loving family unit until he was a teenager when he is ""adopted"" into an existing pack.  After serving as a Beta, he survives a challenge to become their leader.  He is a strong Alpha male who leads his pack with wisdom and a sense of justice unusual for one so young.Elise and Kane are mated to strengthen the political alliance between their two packs.  Unfortunately, Elise is unaware of the impending event and must deal with the loss of her expectations, being intimate with a stranger, leaving her home and relocating to a place where others may or may not accept her.  Additionally, she must find her footing as an Alpha male's wife that forces her to examine how she relates to others as an adult.  Over the course of the book she attempts to feel her way through unfamiliar situations with new people entering her life and discovers the dominant traits that have been dormant, just waiting for the occasions to assert herself and pave her way in her new world.The book describes their journey dealing with being newly mated along with a mystery surrounding the welfare of their pack's territory.  I was struck by the similarity of this storyline to those of historical romance where an arranged marriage is a common theme and the participants must learn to deal with each other as strangers while forging a life for themselves.The writing style is engaging and well paced.  I felt all of my senses participated in the storyline due to the author's descriptive talents. At times, the dialogue was very simplistic (especially in the beginning) but it was not much of a distraction.  It is a complete novel (thank you!) but the ending sets up for a series in a most enjoyable manner.  I'm glad that I gave this book and author a chance.  It was time well spent!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Great book the author is amazing, the writing is like you there with characters and the places, it makes you.",5
B00BTIDW4S,These are great books and have a great story line read the first because it was free would have paid for the rest.what a great surprise,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a great Were-genre book. It was very original! I would've paid for it, but it was free! I've already downloaded the other free ones and I can't wait to read them! This book had werewolves of course, romance, suspense, action, and pack! What more could we want in a book of this genre? I thought it was well written, flowed smoothly, and was very well edited! I will purchase any and all future works by this author! Off to read the others now! Happy Reading!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"New author for me and also the first book i read on a Kindle, so that might have affected my review. I liked the book,  it was quiet long and very descriptive narration. I wil definetly try the second in the series.  I cant say this is a favorite author, but still looking forward to her telling of another mating.",4
B00BTIDW4S,This was my first ever paranormal story back in 2009 and I loved the book so much that I read it three more times since.Nickey Charles has away of drawing you in making the plot believable and entertaining to the very end.I simply could not put it down and once I discovered it was part of a series of four books I had to read them as well. I was not dissapointed at all.A book I can recommend to all lovers of paranormal romance mixed with suspense and budding relationships.A wonderful read,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I absolutely love this book.  I wish I had seen Bonded the prequel to the Mating first.  I am going to go read it then probably re-read The Mating.  Nicky Charles is a great writer in my book.  I read a lot of books and these are fantastic!!  Great story lines and I could not put it down,.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have to admit this story has made me wanted to read the next one. This story will have you captivated from beginning to end. One of the best suspense paranormal stories I have read. In all honesty, I was not aware of this author and took a chance. I was rewarded with a plot that was well written, a love story crafted with intrigue and suspense that kept me turning the pages. The story starts with a conflict and just when you think you know where it's headed, you are catapulted into a spiral. The emotions, descriptions of scenery and transitions keep you guessing at every turn of the page. This story is a must read, especially if werewolves are your passion. I know it has made me a believer. :)!!!!!! I'm off to read The Keeping!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really loved this series and this author! The story line was great, and the characters so easy to get into. So far I have read 4 of the 5 books by this author and though I didn't get them or read them in the right order, I have enjoyed them all. I do have to say that this one was my favorite. Elise is just a young woman who comes home from a romp thru the woods with her boyfriend to find out her father has arranged for her to be mated to the young Alpha of a another pack. She has 3 hours to adjust to the idea!  However, as with all werewolf stories, one does what is best for the pack and that's all there is to it. Kane is a young but mature werewolf that is a little overwhelmed with the problems he's experiencing in trying to take care of his pack, and does neglect his new mate. However the problems plaguing the pack are serious and could be detrimental in all of their lives. Time for a new mate is hard to squeeze in. Enter in a jealous greedy female, an angry brother, and big oil all creating a great story! You won't be able to not get the next book just to find out what's going to happen to this pack family next!  The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars was the editing! Several times a sentence was started and the ending - which should have been on the next page, was gone. However, the story is well worth your time. Its great if you like werewolf stories!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Beautifully written well meshed erotica, romance, and action. With a good hint of mystery. Enjoyed this book, hope others Will too.",4
B00BTIDW4S,In one word...boring boring boring!!!!!! I did not even finish reading the Mating. Too much sappy material and the characters were annoying,1
B00BTIDW4S,It was great. Would definitely recommend. Not typical paranormal romance. Can't wait to read the next book. Hats off to author,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this book . . .Good plot, good character development. Would love a sequel!  Would definitely recommend this book to my book buddies!",4
B00BTIDW4S,I love books about the paranormal. Nicky Charles is a wonderful story teller. The book made me long to read more about this wonderful pack.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Well written story  of Werewolf packs. The dominance and submissions involved in a pack society. Dominance and due justices within the pack society.,4
B00BTIDW4S,When I first downloaded this book I was skeptical and thought to read it out of curiosity.  When I started reading it I was so enwrapped in the plot that I couldn't put it down. I was amazed at how well written the story was. It is an excellent book and recomend it to all paranormal book readers like myself. I enjoyed it so much that I am going to read the rest of the series. Thankyou Nicky for your wonderful books.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I read the whole series..very very exciting. Just couldn't get enough. Certainly kept me on the edge of my seat.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Great book ,couldn't put it down ,loved the plot,ending was great,want to read more by this author,overall s great nook",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This story is on Kane which he was briefly mentioned on the prelude book with Reno and Brandi. Kane marries Elise for political reasons. However, there is Kane' s ex that is trying to sabotage his new relationship with Elise and his wolf pack.I gave it a 3 star because it was interesting how Kane and Elise relationship evolved what with Marla throwing in a monkey wrench at each turn. The part where Bryan, Elise' s old pack friend, come to see Elise and Kane saw them to me was a good one. I like it when a man who is suppose to be Dominant shows his jealousy in a healthy way. Although, I think I would have preferred a confrontation between Kane and Bryan besides the wimpy one in the beginning.",3
B00BTIDW4S,And just think the evil she-wolf has my name. I enjoyed this book immensely. Kane and the pack had such bitterness. I knew they would find the truth. I really hope their is another book coming,4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was  a free download, not the typical type of book I usually read. I was surprised about the book, and did enjoy the plot. There is some explicit sexual content but still a good read.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I really liked the characters in this book. Different enough from other werewolf stories to stay fresh.  Looking forward toMore.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoy this type of story for the character study  they were believable and not vicious  good easy reading  thanks,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed the novel. I could not put it down. I felt the novel inserted a critique on big corporations and the way they maneuver their way to take lands for their benefit while ruining the environment. Besides this, the relationship between Kane and Elise was a sight to watch and uncover for a reader. I recommend this book and I thank the author Nicky Charles for permitting me to read their works. I look forward to finishing the rest of the series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love paranormal romance done by good writers, and this is one of the best written that I've read in quite some time. I highly recommend this interesting story and would enjoy a follow-up.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was almost impossible to put down.  It wasn't overly racy, and just t the right amount of intrigue",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a really good book. I just wish there was more of it seemed like I just couldn't put it down. Loved it....,5
B00BTIDW4S,This is a great story. I love reading romance and really enjoyed this one because it was unique.  I was glad it wasn't too paranormal.  At times throughout I did scream obscenities at Elise.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles has written another great book in the series. I must admit that I was never overly interested in the paranormal romance books before but I've since become a convert.I can't wait to read the next book in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating is a cute story with likeable characters. (With some mild sex thrown in). I enjoyed reading this story and found myself looking for the Nicky Charles website, to see if there were more book to this story.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this book that's all I can really say.  The book flowed nicely and the characters were loveable.  Can't wait for another!,5
B00BTIDW4S,This delightful story is filled with plot twists that kept me interested from the beginning to the end.  Lost one star for gratuitous sex scenes that dragged on and on.,4
B00BTIDW4S,To be honest I found  myself flipping through the sex scenes- I'm sure they were well written but I flipped thru them out of respect for my husband. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a good story even without the sex. At times she annoyed me with how gullible she was but nevertheless it was a good story,5
B00BTIDW4S,Fun to readLooking forward to more in the series!I hope for more puppy LOVE !Great 1st person STORY telling!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I was not sure if this would be a series I would like but I started the series and have grown to love it. I would have liked each book to follow the previous but it has been easy to read and follow the story line.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was pretty good. I was definitely entertained, and liked the story. However,I found it very predictable.The erotic scenes are a different, worthy of a five star rating on their own.  They are so arousing! She writes erotica well, it makes my heart thump at times.  I'm certainly planning on reading the next book. And will definitely see if she's written any volumes of erotica.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"A really great read! Could not put it down from the beginning, I look forward to reading more books in this series! Definitely takes you to another world hidden in our own.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I couldn't put it Down. Love all the books, I love reading long books but this one did it for me...I would definitely recommend... ;0)",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is an AWESOME series of books... I couldn't put down my Kindle...I told everyone about them...I will gladlyreread these!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I picked this up on a recommendation and I am so glad I did. I needed some light reading while stuck in a hotel room and this was perfect. A very nice plot and the characters were likeable (for the most part). I enjoyed the idea that you can make something special of a bad situation. I really didn't pick this up for the romantic aspect and more for the werewolf aspect. It was a fun glimpse into a brand new world! I've already downloaded the other books in this series! Just a great, light read and a talented (new to me) author!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Hey just wanted to write This  review and say that at first I didn't want to read this book but IM so glade I did it is really a very good book. If you haven't read it or bought it you have to it's a must read!!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love this series!Even though Kane and Elise meet while unifying their packs, Kane is considerate and cares for Elise.I am enjoying this series, finished book 3 out of 5.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I give this close to 4 stars.  It was ok/I liked it. Since this is a free book no real complaints but I prefer the main female character to have more backbone and to be a little smarter than this one (Elise) was.I also felt that the relationship between Elise and her mate was lacking.  Yes they managed to hit the sheets together but there was no real bonding outside of the rare talk.Lots of room for improvement but as I said, overall it was ok.  I thought some areas were very slow but others were fast so it almost balanced out.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I liked this book. Good read and I like all the characters in the series so yes it's a must read book,3
B00BTIDW4S,My only complaint is that I read it to fast. Lol!! Guess that's what happens when a book is good and all you can do is keep turning the pages. Thanks :-),5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Bonded. These characters were entertaining and you couldn't help but really root for Elise and Kane. Going to start the next book!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love this book and this author. It isn't about just loving but action as in the shoot me down kind. The character were great. I went out of my way to find this series just to own them all.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Got sucked into the story line very quickly and was left wondering what happened to them after the book was done.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"How good was this!!! It had everything. You had old traditions, New love, friendship, loyalty and  best of all drama. The book had a nice flow to it. The author allowed you to feel each character's role. I can actually feel the journey of Elise and Kane's romance. It had the right amount of heat has well. Hot and steamy.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I didn't know if I was going to get a good book because it was free but it was a wonderful read. A real page turner, I enjoyed the different way in which it started and waited to find out how it would end up. I was all but yelling at who the real culprit was but even I was a little taken aback by the other conspirator that popped out near the end. I love it when I can't figure it all out before the end. Five stars!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"ok, so after reading BONDED, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I started reading Mating.. which apparently was the next order of reading. However rather than picking up with Damien's story (which had a huge cliffhanger involving him), we get Kane's story.While I enjoyed the read somewhat, Elise's character was getting on my nerves. I know she's essentially young & inexperienced in the ways of the ""were-world"", but I guess a selfish part of me wanted her to grow up and figure things out already. However she does wise up a bit towards the end and then she does something else that leaves me a bit uncomfortable. It made me think that this young girl has no business being mated to anyone. Essentially it wasn't her choice, so I guess you take the Bad with the Bad. The majority of the story is told from her POV which probably attributed to the annoyance. While BONDED gave a balanced 2 person POV.. MATING is mostly from Elise's POV with one chapt dedicated to Kane's POV ( and with good reason)bottom line did I hate the story? NO. For the most part it kept my interest and the story moved along with sufficient suspense of the ""who dunnit"".. but I wasn't wow'ed by it as I was with BONDED",3
B00BTIDW4S,I can see why everyone has be raving about this series. I lovethe way all the characters come together.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Written with a classic &#34;slow to burn&#34; style, this story takes on the long ago compulsory marriage story-line to it's logical conclusion. However, the unique handling of the paranormal elements adds enough interest to carry the book. As an early book in this series, it may move more slowly than it should to capture the reader's attention and encourage further reading. However, after reading seven books in this series, I can honestly say it is a series worth reading. This is a book that establishes many of the traditions and roles needed to carry the reader through some awesome reads and is far from being droll. I can't wait till book eight comes out.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I am still reading.. I like for the most part but so far Elise is ...i dont know not dynamic enough and Kane is either stupid or clueless.. I am not passing judgement yet buts its frustrating that this is a typical plot.. male  / female / third party causing trouble but one is always clueless..  I will finish then review again.. I also prefer multiple points of view not just one character's thoughts and what they hear... elise is getting on my nerves. Later in the evening now it got a little better. .. I will try the next books. ..,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I don't usually read about werewolves but this one got my attention. Great suspense, interesting characters and hunky men! I'll try some more Nicky and. I'm a dog walker for the Humane Society!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was the first book of this series that I read. I was hooked right away! I recommend the entire series to anyone who wants a believable werewolf story, with honest love included. Yes there are some steamy scenes, but the love is more the focus. This story focused on a young lady who never met her mate before the day the were mated! Unbelievable right? In this day and age?? As the story progresses, you get suspense, and thriller tossed into the mix. Excellent read. I highly suggest it!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I was excited to read another story in this series. I'm looking forward to finding out about Ryne next and more about the &#34;rogues&#34;,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I've had this book for awhile but always held off on reading it because of the mixed reviews.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I thought it was really good.The book focuses on Elise, she is a 19 year old she wolf. She lives with her pack and she is completely happy, then one day without warning, her father who is Alpha of the pack tells her she is going to be mated that day to an Alpha male of another pact so that an alliance can be formed.The book follows Elise and her mate as they get to know each other. I thought that considering the culture of the plot, the book flowed well. There was not an instant fall in love with this story line.The only issue I had was that Elise acted way to naive in the beginning.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I kept page turning to see what would happen next. Nicky Charles definitely has a  way captivating  the  reader. Will be reading the next one!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"So far I have read the first two books. To my surprise they are slightly linked, but that is all in very small details. So these books could easily be stand alones. This is a very sweet and hot romance with WEREWOLVES! How awesome is that.  I appreciate your work and Thank you for sharing it for free.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is probably one of the greatest paranormal romance thriller. Truly enjoyed it and wish there was more to Elise and Kane' s story. Expecting and hoping more from this author. Truly a great read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I could not put this down. This story had me speed reading to reach the end, then I was sad. The characters are very well developed and this story has a great mix of drama, mystery, suspense and of course romance. Worth reading!!!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I was immediately drawn into the life of werewolves and finished the book in record time. Although the spelling could use some improvement, it wasn't as bad as some and not a huge deterrent while reading. Looking forward to the sequel, which I have already downloaded.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"(mrs.featherpicker reviewing)This was such a good story. Elise is tough but at first, it seemed to me, she was just a tat wimpy. Of course being young and thrown into a political arranged marriage was pretty mind numbing I suppose but as the story unfolded you could see and feel her backbone finally emerging. Excellent characters, excellent amounts of mystery and just the right amount of humor in the right places. I have a new author now to add to my list of favorites.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I can't wait to read the next book I  anxious to see what happens in Canada.Great plot ... Leaves you wanting more,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as Bonded.  The whole Marla character was beyond transparent and the story was too predictable and just felt like High School Drama and made me ill!  Because I enjoyed Bonded so much, I'll continue to the next one but this one was meh!",3
B00BTIDW4S,Love stories like this but wish it had a bit less sex and in depth descriptive pages of it. Sex is great but Page after page gets plum tiresome.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This is the second one in the series and so far I am enjoying it. I have always been fascinated with wolves and this is giving me the best of both human and wolf.  Can't wait to start the next in the series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I read Bonded first then Betrayed before The Mating.  So far it's been a great series.  Sometimes I wondered about the characters being gullible (I won't name who) but she was able to redeem herself at the end.  Super crazy plot twists.  Now I'm on to the next book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Elise was a cute character but nothing much stood out from her apart from being totally nave. There were some attempts of trying to portray her as a strong female but I didn't really buy it. She did exactly what everyone told her to do including being mated with a total stranger.A couple of times where she supposedly stood up for herself were really weak and it wasn't what she said or did that made her the ""winner"" but more of the fact that the other person backed down for an unknown reason. I always have trouble with protagonists in a story being dishonest and keeping secrets for no apparent reason.That Marla character was so obvious and I was surprised Elise was falling for her tricks considering she knew what kind of a person she is and that nobody in the pack thought her trustworthy. It actually went so far that Elise was giving Marla precedence over her own mate by letting her manipulate her into keeping secrets and lying to Kane. I know that was all a set up for what happened later but it just showed how weak of a character Elise was which I'm sure wasn't the author's intent.The story itself wasn't original or surprising but still rather interesting to read. The author has a nice writing style and I enjoyed reading it.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles is awesome. This book was a page-turner from beginning to end. Excellent writer, she keeps you reading right to the last page and then you want more. Cannot wait to read her next books...",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was too stressful.  The action was soooooooo drawn ooooout!  It made the intrigue way too hard to deal with.  Instead of it being exciting, it was excruciating.  I just can't stand to sit back and watch people get back-stabbed and suffer in slow motion.  I don't really recommend this book, unless you love soap operas.  It's not my cup of tea.  It went so slow that I would get bored and angry.  I want to know what happens, but I can't stand to slog through the last 42% of the book.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was a great way to start out this series. I loved the fact that you kind of knew what was going to happen, but still left you sort of guess what's next. I loved the plot and character interactions and everything else in between.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this book.  It had just enough angst to keep the mystery going. I would have liked a little more interaction between. Marla and Kane to add some more drama for Elise.Looking forward to reading book #3.  Hopefully Rayne will get his own story soon.,2
B00BTIDW4S,"If you like werewolves, a murder mystery (even if it is easy to figure out who did it and why) and arranged marriages that turn into true love. This is the book for you.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I loved the story I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series hopefully there just as good.,5
B00BTIDW4S,More to this book than I thought ! I couldn't put it down and wish there was a 2nd !,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I wasn't going to read this after reading the review that complained about rape and women's rights.. but I was curious and I'm glad I read it!  Although there are two scenes I didn't care for, if I edited this book I would simply remove the word 'no' from them and it wouldnt be as bad. But then again, it could be that I was looking for negative things after reading that stupid review. I don't remember the reviewer's name but the review was WAY TOO HARSH!  This was a good book and I'm glad I read it despite my initial doubts.  I recommend it, I liked it!  And I especially liked that it was very long.  Too many books end before I'm ready for them to.  Great work!",4
B00BTIDW4S,I can't say that I have never read a book this great for at least 3 years. I can't wait to read the second book. :),5
B00BTIDW4S,This book was a true pleasure. The characters were brilliantly brought to life and each word pulled me deeper into the story and the world it created.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I am waiting for another, I will be looking forward to more of your books, can sit back and relax while i read and get away.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Unfortunately I started the series backwards and read this one first but I was captured by the way Nicky portrays her characters. I'm reading the first book in the series now and although it hasn't grabbed me right away I'm starting to get into it as she is now mentioning characters that are the center of the Mating before they were the main characters. I will read all the series for sure. Please write a follow up to the Mating, have to see if our bad girl is really dead or if she got away.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a decent read, I enjoyed the personal experience of the main characters as they navigated the circumstances of their relationship and found love in spite of everything.  It was a little slow going at first, but definitely worth sticking with it to the end.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Have to stop ready Nicky Charles so I can catch up on my sleep. Full of hot sex, suspense, love triangled  brothers, a great read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This book has both romance and suspense.  It was well written and easy to read.  Read all of series...you won't be disappointed.  You will anxiously wait for her next book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"As paranormal books gain popularity, I didn't think a werewolf tale would catch my attention.  However, I was wrong.  Interesting characters and twists kept me reading.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating was well written, with a well developed storyline. There were a few slow patches where I found myself skimming, but overall, it held my attention throughout. Kane was so very deliciously alpha male, but with a heart of gold. I loved him from the beginning. Elise came across as a nave teenager with some growing up to do, but had a bit of backbone, given the situation. The villain was fun to hate. The notion of an arranged marriage for political alliance is archaic and feminists will surely balk, but I still loved it. It's fiction, people. Overall, if you like steamy paranormal with a hot, dominant male, then The Mating is a great read for you.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a great book. I so enjoyed Kane.  I thought Elise was out of her mind by always telling Marla her business. I would give this book 10 stars if I could.  I hate I didn't read the prequel. I was up all night because I couldn't put it down,  I will say that there was a moment when Elise was teling Marla everything that turned me off.  I didn't want Elise to be stupid.  In the end, all turned out great.  I'm just worried that Elise might have a little bit of  ho ho ho in her.  She was soooo attracted to Rhyne.  Great job Nicky!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this story and would love to hear more about Ryne AND DANIEL and Bryan. I would recommend this to family and friends.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Great book.  I love a good werewolf storyline and I was not disappointed with this one.  I am eager to read the sequel and it is ready and waiting for me.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love this book the author explains every situation so clearly it's like you are standing right beside the character! I recommend this book if you want sexy action and werewolf drama.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This book was free here at Amazon - So is the Sequel and the Prequel. I read the book today because I couldn't put it down. It was different then most of the other shifter stories I've read. I really enjoyed the characters. The romantic tension was good and it was a decent plot. There were times that the author became long winded ... I found myself skimming over and ignoring some parts to get to the meat of the story. It was well written and engaging and I plan on starting the next book tomorrow.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I totally loved reading this book. The author brings out the characters so well that you feel like you are there with them. hope there are more books to this follow this one.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Good read. Not great, but good. The heroine could have asserted herself a bit more. I mean, just letting things happen to you, instead of taking an active ""alpha"" role. Not a good alpha female. But still a good story.",3
B00BTIDW4S,This was a good book. I enjoyed reading the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read this kind of book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Since I know this is book one, I can't wait for book two. This one was romantic, exciting and adventurous.  Loved everything about it.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Just like the 2 previous law of the lycans books, this this story captivates you at the first page! I think I finished this one fadter than the previous one due to my expectations which proved correct. If you haven't picked up this serious by Nicky Charles, than you are clearly not living fully! Btw I rated it a 5 star not 2",2
B00BTIDW4S,"This book kept my interest the whole way through it has a little bit of everything in it romance,mystery and twists the author is amazing and i cant wait to read the other books",5
B00BTIDW4S,I will be reading the rest of this series. Hope they are just as good. I really enjoyed this book!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"No. I could read novels by this author every day all day.  I hope there are more books out there by him.  I love the colorful endearing character as, e email the bad guys.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"The book was pretty good, I wouldn't mind reading more from Nicky Charles.  I thought this book was related to movies about the Lycans.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading.  It offers something for everyone of age; a thriller and a love drama.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is the third book written by Nicky Charles that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. She is a good writer and even though I don't usually read paranormal books, I do enjoy her books.",3
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed every moment of this book.  A great story with lots of action.  The characters were very interesting and intriguing.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I don't write many review but this series is the best, read my other reviews for Nicky Charles books.  You will not go wrong with this series.  I just want more books.  Make sure you read in the proper order.  I could not put this book down or any of the other nicky charles books.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Kane and Elise try to make a go of it from the start. The H/h in a forced/arranged marriage romance story line don't do this a lot, in my experience. It was refreshing to see two people decide ""Well, nothing we can do about it now. Might as well get along instead of making each other miserable."" THANK YOU Ms. Charles!!! Elise had plans of her own for who she wanted to mate. Who knows what Kane was thinking before, but I doubt it was marriage to a stranger. I felt for Elise, being thrown into mating a man for the sake of her pack.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"The Mating (Law of the Lycans)I would have given this a better score, but Kane did rape his mate.  But it was ok because Elise was in heat and had an orgasm during the rape.Elise was 19 years old and had no ambition to go to college or gain a skill.  She had no money. And the best she could hope for was a part time waitressing job.  And she didn't even get that on her own.  Most of the women in their pack shopped, cooked, washed dishes and produced pups.I know that the constant interuptions and Elise never getting the opportunity to tell Kane anything was necessary for Marla's diabolical plan to play out.  But it did get old and annoying.There were a few instances other than the rape that you realized that Kane was controlling and a little scary.  But the rest of the time he was romantic and thoughtful.Elise was more mature in her thoughts than she was in her actions.But still the book was entertaining and had a couple of twists. And I will read the next book.",3
B00BTIDW4S,It was interesting and easy reading.  Good book. Will read the next one . NEVER thought I would read about werewolf' s.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Wow, this was a unique and interesting book. Werewolves in love and existing  in the world. It caught my attention and left me hungry for more. Should be a movie!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I read the reviews about this being chauvinist and parading the rape and so on.Well I am old fashioned lady. I am submissive and I love dominant men. So this book fits me perfectly!Down-sides:  I was expecting more danger...than a single bitch (Marla). I was really expecting Ryne the bad wolf harming her and Kane having the opportunity to be the hero.Then I knew that there is a second book based on Ryne....and no I will not read. Being defeated once he does not appeal me at all.So....this will be the only book of the &#34; Law of the Lycans&#34; I will read.Thanks for the wonderful story!,4
B00BTIDW4S,This was really boring.  The hero and heroine were both simple boring characters.  There was not any chemistry between them.  Story line was simple.  I'm glad I got this book for free.,2
B00BTIDW4S,I love werewolf stories that give you the impression that they could really happen in today's world. It was not cheesy or overdone. Good story line and good sex!!!  I would like to read more of this genre from this author. The family dynamic is one I want to know more about. I really liked it in other words.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Good thing this book was free!  I didn't think it was a horrible read but it wasn't good.  I was bored with it.  Kane and Elise weren't very strong characters.  Neither really stood out to me, especially Kane.  He was hot...that's about all I got out of it.  Elise was..well, she was just stupid.  The plot was obvious.  I flipped through half the book not really caring about the build up because again, it was obvious who the &#34;bad&#34; guy was so the ending was no surprise.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"I agree with every one star review this book received.  If I could, I would have given it -5 stars.  I got the book free and still paid too much. I've read my fair share of werewolf/lycan stories and I like strong alphas and heroines. I couldn't drum up enough interest to finish the story. The writing is unimaginative, lackluster, and I know why the book is free.I downloaded all the books from this series, now I have to go through the trouble of deleting them from my device.",1
B00BTIDW4S,If you are contemplating not reading this series then stop now.....this is a must read if you love romance and paranormal,5
B00BTIDW4S,The story follows the mating of Kane and Elise but it has more that just romance. The book provides suspense and mystery as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by Nicky Charles.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"have always loved lycan stories, no exception here, have enjoyed this immensely, very interesting story line, in this book and in the series, will continue to look for more",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I just finished this book and it was great! I'm about to read Bonded, and then will follow with the rest. I was shocked at how fast it drew me in because I'm not usually into paranormal books. Guess it's time to order a few more. I thought the character development was very good. It combines action and suspense with romance and love.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I was blown away by this book. I stumbled accrosed it and was truly suprised at how good it was. This is a good book,5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed reading this book. The characters  came to life in such a warming way. I am looking forward to the next book.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky Charles has proven to be a great romance and mystery writer in one. This book kept my attention from beginning to end.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Not bad but could have been better. The alpha needed his hand held too often and the male POV and dialogue was often too effeminate to lend the alphas any badassness. Both the hero and heroine got on my nerves. The plotline was engaging though and kept me reading.,2
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked this book. I especially liked the character of Kane, not just his looks and his power, but also his character and his tenderness. And if that wasn't enough, the author introduces a look-alike half-brother, Ryne, who looks just like Kane, except that the brother has blue eyes -- even better! The heroine, Elise,is likable and courageous and the villainess, Marla,is devious and evil. Even though this was a full length book, I expect that there is more to this story. I hope to see Helen get the chance to get payback against Marla for the murder of her husband. And I look forward to finding out what happens with Ryne in his new settlement, and whatever became of Marla, who was thought to be dead, but then the body disappears, leaving us to wonder, ""Is she still alive""?",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Ok a lot of people ""critics"" are appalled by the story says it is about rape if you have never been rapped then you have no idea what rape is. It also is insulting to think this is sexist, it is obvious either the critics are either frigid or just prudish. There was no rape involved good lord. Seducing yes, rape no. It cannot be called rape if the participant enjoyed it. Rape is forced that was not the case in this book, I would say it is most slanderous in saying so.The story was good it gave a good storyline, it was also well thought out, and I loved the whole series. Thank you Nicky for taking the time to use your imagination and give it freely. I did not find any typos or grammical errors.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Outstanding and entertaining, great story telling and keeps you enthralled so it's hard to put down . If you enjoy reading about love and a great relationship between two people you need to get this book . I really enjoyed this book and this author",5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this story immensely  The werewolf portion was a little odd for me but I followed the love story completely. Great lead in to a follow up story on Ryne.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I debated writing this review since I had already wasted enough time reading the book. I like paranormal romance when it's done right. The Mating was a case of a paranormal romance done wrong. Very wrong. This book was a freebie for me and I had feeble hopes of mediocrity, but this book was downright terrible. I would strongly advise you not to read this book UNLESS you like the following:1. An idiotic heroine. Elise, oh Elise. The heroine is an 18 year old who has a noodle for a backbone. She barely resists: an arranged marriage; forced taking of her virginity; manipulation by Marla at every corner; rape; and having her whole life dictated to her like she's a subhuman being with no rights. Worse yet, she doesn't even complain after the events happen. Elise was a perfect combination of stupidity, passivity, and weakness. Also, she may have been part zombie and deaf-mute as she barely talked or emoted. I'm pretty sure the amount of her actual dialogue only added up to 2 pages.2. Dubious Consent, Non-Consent, & Rape Scenes. There's this trend nowadays in erotica to incorporate uber dominant males and aggressive sex scenes. Nothing wrong with that. However, when aggressive sex trespasses into ""non-consent"" territory? That's where I have a problem. That's rape, ladies and gentlemen. The sexual encounter in the beginning of the book is in the dubious consent pile and even though Elise didn't want to go along with it, she did. But the sexual encounter towards the end of the book where she blatantly says she doesn't want it? Rape. And Elise (via the author's poor writing) never even addressed that she had been violated. 0_o Great message to send out to women (and men): rape is a-okay IF: the rapist is extremely attractive, the sex is orgasmic, and you were too lazy to at least pretend to fight him off. So ""no"" in fact means ""yes"" essentially. This is irresponsible writing, and I'm disgusted that it's becoming more commonplace in romance and erotica novels.3. Insta-love. I detest it. Elise supposedly is in love with her childhood friend Bryan but does nothing to fight her arranged marriage. Within 2 days, she's already in love with Kane and Bryan is a distant memory. What was the point of bringing Bryan into the story if there was no angsty love triangle? I attribute this to weak character development and amateur writing skills.4. Anti-feminism. Outside of about 3 female pack members, most don't have a college education or a job. They are used as breeders, shoppers, housewives, maids, etc and tend to do copious amounts of laundry, cooking and showering. Enhancing your intellect or at least having a hobby? Meh, not necessary. Needless to say, my delicate feminist sensibilities were offended.5. Third person. The entire book? Narrated by dumbo Elise? I hated it. I hated that Elise supposedly had all these detailed and bold thoughts in her head but came across as a 2-d robot when it was time to act. Boo Nicky. Boo.Gems of Elise's stupidity and ignorance:""Is being pregnant really difficult?"" ARE YOU 12??? She's already had sex with Kane numerous times and is just now asking about the consequences of the birds and the bees? Come on, grow up.""We talked about it. My heat will start next week and I think I'll go drug free and see what happens, especially since I don't react well to the drugs."" Wait... 2 pages before she wanted to hold off on having kids but now wants to go off birth control? And then just ""see what happens""? What do you think is going to happen idiot?I'm going to advise Nicky Charles to take quite a few writing classes. Everyone is not meant to be an author (well, a for-profit author). Also, keep this book priced at FREE DOLLARS in order to gain more feedback and non-hostile reviews. If I had paid for this book - this review would have a lot more expletives. In fact, because I read it within the 7 day frame, I'd be returning it to Amazon. Luckily it was free. Unluckily, the preposterousness of this book will not be forgotten.",1
B00BTIDW4S,"Elise finds herself mated to a stranger for political reasons. Now she is far from her home and facing uncertainty and an extremely jealous woman. Falling in love with her husband/mate was not in the cards. Can he fall in love with her when the truth is covered up in so many lies?I have to admit that the free price was what attracted me to the book, but the story kept me reading to the end. I found that the plot was well done, and the storyline was engaging. There was tension, romance, mystery, and suspense - all the elements I love.The characters were well done. I don't think I would have taken being forced into such a relationship on the spur of the moment as well as Elise did, but she was an obedient member of the pack and to her father. It was obvious that the jealous woman was up to no good, but the true extent of the mysterious happenings is a complete surprise. I'll stop there and not give away anything. That would ruin the read.You'll find in this read intense passion and mystery. There are some hot scenes, but not many as the book pleasantly focuses on the relationships and the mystery over the intimate scenes. I loved that. If you really want an enjoyable paranormal/romance/suspenseful read, check out this book. You won't regret it.Note: I purchased this book on my own with no one expecting a positive review.",4
B00BTIDW4S,I have just finished reading this book for the second time and it just gets better and better every time I read it. This author is truly talented!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed  the characters and world building in this story.  No weak, whiney, alpha or heroine here.  It was action packed and I would respectfully refer friends to read it.  I wanted a steamy story to enjoy for the weekend and Nicky Charles delivered.  The dynamics of th  relationships of the characters were well written and to find a bit of mystery, action, and thrills all contained in a paranormal erotic/romance novel was a wonderful surprise.  I will definitely start gathering more Nicky Charles books and make donations to animal shelters if anymore come to me free of  charge.  Thank you Ms Charles for the fun read.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I couldn't put this book down. I started it this morning, only planning to read for an hour. Here I  am  finishing it.....Can't wait to read another.....",5
B00BTIDW4S,"So I haven't read many werewolf stories, I prefer rocker, college and fighter romances, but I must say that I really liked this story. I really loved the mental and physical connection that happens between a wolf and its mate. The steamy scenes were HOT! I was a bit upset with Elise because she could have stopped some of the drama in the book by revealing things sooner and trusting her instincts to tell the truth, but I guess her faults gave the story more of a twist.I'm eager to see what happens with Marla and Ryne in the next story and I really hope Bryan finds love. Overall I enjoyed this book a lot and would recommend it to friends.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This book was pretty good. I like the whole background story. The heroine though was a little dense at times,4
B00BTIDW4S,I figured since this entire series was free that it wouldn't be so great. Boy was I wrong!! I was hooked on the series pretty quickly. I really like this author's style of writing. She keeps your interest all the way through. This first book is mainly a out Kane and Elise but introduces you to many more characters especially towards the end as some them will be what the next book focuses on. I absolutely loved this first book!!! I kept looking for inconsistencies in the story but couldn't find any. Just a few spelling and grammatical errors but that's it. Ready to move on to second book....,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I found these free books on a couple different websites and took a chance on the first one.  As an avid reader of paranormal romance and editor, I was impressed with the storyline, content and editing.  I think I will go on to book two. I believe Marla will be making an appearance.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles has crafted a facinating look at a werewold pack. The Alpha male, Kane, and his new mate Elise have just been bonded, but not blood-bonded. Meanwhile her coming to his pack is not welcomed by all the pack members. At least one is unhappy, and is scheming to get rid of Elise. Who this wolf is, how s/he reacts to Elise's arrival, and how this antipathy plays out are the skeleton of the story.The flesh comes from insights into pack politics, the way a pack lives within its territory, and the struggles of Kane and Elise to establish themselves as the true leaders of the pack are told in a way that might make a sociologist drool, if said sociologists had real a real werewolf pack to study. And therein lies the craft behind Nicky Charles' story telling.This book also has a prequelBonded (Prequel to The Mating)as well as a sequelThe Keeping (Sequel to The Mating). I am looking forward to reading both novels. Look for my reviews by the end of next week. Meanwhile, if you haven't readThe Mating (Law of the Lycans)I absolutely urge you to do so.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Easy to read, fills your spot to not have to retain something, just relax and let the story go.  Worth the time.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Nicky has a way of telling her story in a way to keep you at your Kindle for hours on end. I didn't believe in Werewolfs before but I think I do now.  I appreciated the fact that Nicky shared her stories free to us old focks just getting by on our social security monies.  Again great read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really like the characters in this . Love conquerors all. The new way of the packs is entertaining. A good read. I have all of the series,4
B00BTIDW4S,Started with the free sample.In my opinion the writing is well done.  I see gripes in some of the Nicky Charles reviews.  I have now loaned my copy out to see if my friend will like thi sort of boo.,5
B00BTIDW4S,This story had all the elements of a decent romance. For those of you who do not like alot of graffic language or explicit sex scenes then you will like this book. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I like the explicit sex scenes. While there is some sexy scenes in the book I cant say they burned my socks off. But all in all it is a good read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Fast paced easy reading. I didn't, want  the story to end. Intense feelings by all the characters. Truly believable. I felt the love as well as the conflicts. A real treat.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This story has just the right amount of sweet and sexy.  I loved this story, great story line easy read, a good beach book...I enjoyed the characters, really believable.  This was a wonderful, romantic story with just the right amount of angst and suspense to make the love story sensual and endearing.  With just enough twists that you find yourself saying WoW I didn't see that coming, and surprising me is not easy.  Very easily a read again.  Well done Nicky.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was great! Im not usually into the whole wolf thing but this sucked me in. the characters were great, the plot had a lot of intrigue and kept me turning pages to see what would happen. I can't believe it's a free read!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I debated whether to download this book. So glad I did. Well written, good story line that held my interest. I look forward to other books by this author. Just downloaded the sequel. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed reading this book by Nicky Charles. Well written has romance, danger, and intrique all in one.Highly recommend this if you like fantasy / werewolves.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a great read and kept me interested the whole time! I highly recommend! Can't wait to read the next!,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very well written book. It had me not wanting to put the kindle down until the whole book was read. I highly recommended the book a must read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,you have to get to the middle before you just can't put it down I skipped parts that just seemed to drone on and on but I love both the main characters and then is awesome too. I enjoyed a majority of the book,3
B00BTIDW4S,"I love this book!! The emotions are so real and the story is interesting. I can't wait to star the next one. I have them all, they were all free! So excited. Again great book!",5
B00BTIDW4S,four stars because the author can pull off a wonderful series with her Lycans. I enjoyed . it and have started the next book.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I thought this was a good werewolf story. It was well written, well edited, and had characters I could connect with. I really enjoyed reading it. I found bits of it really frustrating though. Some parts of it were exceedingly predictable. I mean who didn't see Marla coming? Who didn't want to absolutely wring Elise's neck for trusting her even a little bit? I think this was also a little unrealistic. I'm fairly sure most women wouldn't have after their first initial meetings. Same thing goes for Elise's frequent Scarlet O'hara moments. If you have something THAT important to say, let alone multiple important things to say you find a time you don't wait for tomorrow over and over again. There were an unreasonable number of interruptions. But these are just gripes really, part of the overall story, not any sort of comment on the value of the book. I got it for free and am glad to have given it a chance. I've got the sequel (The Keeping) and be reading it too.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"*Written By Jill Bradley*Elise is a nineteen year old who has been surprised by an arranged marriage to a twenty-five year old Kane. Elise happens to also be a werewolf, but this doesn&#8217;t really have any kind of barring on the plot of the story, except that she leaves her own pack and has to join Kane&#8217;s pack. The story is more about the interactions between Elise and Kane&#8217;s pack. How she tries to integrate herself into the social structure. There&#8217;s an evil ex-girlfriend and even an evil brother that she has to deal with. Nefarious plots of environmental contamination and subterfuge. But mostly, it&#8217;s just high school girls picking on each other and a couple lying to one another. This is one of those books where you&#8217;re yelling the whole time, &#8220;JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER!&#8221; It has interesting, partially developed characters, and a decent plot.***********PLOT: 3 StarsA decent story, I think that the love story could have been more powerful. Especially with the arranged marriage, there could have been a lot more to this story, but it just fell short. The story about the backstabbing and environmental plots was actually pretty well thought out, and could have been handled a lot better. Instead it was just kind of thrown in the middle of this high school story, it almost didn&#8217;t belong.WRITING: 3 StarsThe style of writing was passable. Again, it&#8217;s nothing to write home about. It&#8217;s one of those stories where you know all the facts and the character doesn&#8217;t for a LONG time so you&#8217;re frustrated at the idiot bumbling through the story. It&#8217;s also one of those books that could have been fixed on the second page if the characters just sat down and talked. I don&#8217;t have a lot of patience for those kinds of stories.COVER:  1 StarsI mean&#8230;I don&#8217;t hate it&#8230;CHARACTERS: 2 StarsThis is the part that really got me pissed. I did NOT like Elise. She was a weird mixture of immature naivet&eacute; and creepy step ford wife. She would secretely meet up with an ex-boyfriend and have no idea why anyone in her husband&#8217;s family would be angry about it, and then turn around and sit placidly reading a book while the man worked in his office. She threw a big fit about wanting to be independent, so she got a job.  A job? Really, that&#8217;s all you need? But I&#8217;m sure she would speak to someone, we just didn&#8217;t really get along.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"A fun romp. Wishing I could grow some fur and run free. I will purchase the books to follow in this series asap !!!I will buy other books by this author,I'll bet they are fun and sexy also.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Downloaded as a free book but had I known how much I would enjoy it, I would have gladly paid!  Characters were fun and sweet, at least all but a couple, and the story flowed and was a good little mystery . Definitely worth your time to discover!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Interest and exciting book. Enjoyed reading the book and recommend the book to others if they like reading werewolf books.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I really could have loved this book! It was right up my alley. I Loved the story... But.... 90% of this book was inner dialogue from the inside of the h's head... It was to the point that I really believe that she was COO COO for COCO Puffs! And couldn't have a real conversation outside of her own head! I skimmed most of it. IF you love a book that is mostly inner dialogue from the h's head you'll love this book. For me it was just too much. What's more sad is I see she has written Bryan's story and I would really like to know what happens with him... But I WILL NOT put myself through that again.. I gave this book 2 stars for what is could have been!,2
B00BTIDW4S,"I really like this series of books.  I think it is awesome that they are free.  I have followed request to donate to the local animal shelter.  In fact, i came home with a little grey and white kitten.Keep writing",5
B00BTIDW4S,It was a great story. A little to much sex but a fantastic story. I find wolves beautiful and very fascinating. What if there really were werewolves?  Wouldn't this be great if they really lived .,3
B00BTIDW4S,"The characters were great, but the story was predictable. I wanted to scream at Elise, the main character, for being so clueless about what was going on. found myself skipping pages just to get to some action.",3
B00BTIDW4S,Very cute story line. Great read...some intense moments and we'll written. Enjoy the read. Better that the sequel. Teen appropriate.,4
B00BTIDW4S,Love it! Great story. Allison strings were tied up nicely in a hot steamy bow! The writing transported you right inside the book. This is an author to watch. Cannot wait for more!,5
B00BTIDW4S,What a lovely book! but damn.... did it have to take the entire book before they got together? I mean really?!?!?! it just dragged on and on and on....,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love werewolves. Totally and completely. So I'm always on the lookout for new books that look that they will be decent. And then, a few days ago, I discover 5 NEW WEREWOLF books (!!!) and all by the same author. I started reading this book, got about 50 pages in, and bought the other 4, no questions asked.This book was excellent. I loved Elise. She's tough. She will stand up to the Alpha. But will he ever love her?! I loved Kane. He's had a rough life. He's just trying to do the right thing by his Pack. Oh, and what exactly do you do with a mate anyway (besides mate, that is)? All these questions will be answered. And the villain? Let's just say that you will know EXACTLY who the villain is from the first paragraph this person enters the story. And hell if this person isn't over-the-top evil. A great story has a great villain and this one delivers. Oh, how I wished many times that a house would fall out of the sky and land on this person's head, but I just had to wait until almost the very end to see if such a meteor would fall.I raced through this book, and I have a feeling that I'll race through the other 4. Therefore, I have emailed Ms. Charles and asked her to write faster.:)I only had one criticism - Elise gets set up for something, and Kane does something pretty damned awful to her.  I think the later circumstances they found themselves in saved him from a lot of groveling. A TON of groveling. And that should have been portrayed. Hint: Greta Rideout.Incidentally, I have no clue what all these complaints are about this book not being free. I have paid $6.99 for 150 pages of crap. I think paying $.99 for a 300 page book is well worth it.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I love the way this book keeps the readers attention. The way it takes your mind into the adventure is both creative and fun.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I absolutely love these Nicky Charles books. I can't hardly do anything other than read to see what is next. I am excited to start on the next book. I highly recommend this series of books. I had no idea I liked werewolf books until I read these.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love to read books that have sequels.  I always find myself wanting to know more about the characters and their story by the time I'm done with the book.  There are 5 books to this series and that's the main reason I started with this one.  I also like that one of the five is a prequel so I'm looking forward to reading that.  This book kept my interest all the way from beginning to end.  Just like most romance books it isn't too hard to figure out what may happen next, but there were enough twists that I felt surprised by what happened a couple of times.  It's an easy read and by the time I was about half way through it I couldn't put it down until I had read the complete thing.  Im looking forward now to starting the next one.  Go Nicky Charles!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I liked this book and it caused me to get the other 2. I preffered this one more than the other two books in the series.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I normally like mysteries and suspense and I guess this is to some degree. Normally don't like scif but found this book very good reading,5
B00BTIDW4S,First off I rated this book 5 stars because the story n the effect of being unable to put it Down had me reading every chapter participating the next part of the story and where the characters were going and what type of adventure they would encounter. I would and have recommended this to many friends to read to say the least they won't be disappointed. :),5
B00BTIDW4S,This book was a good read and well written. The ending was great with  Ryne  being cleared. Would recommend this to others. Added value being free!,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I started this book as soon as I put down ""Bonded"". It was a little bit of a struggle with such a shift in characters, especially after getting attached to the characters in the previous book. But boy am I glad the author opened with something interesting then uses almost a flashback on how they lead up to that point. Once afain, I found myself in love with these characters too. On a side note, the mystery was a bit predictable, but the author didnt make her characters seem stupid when they couldnt connect the events.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I love werewolf romances have read a lot of them. This one is one of the better ones. It has a little bit of everything. Greed, corruption, betrayal, suspense, love and a lot of good sex.",5
B00BTIDW4S,The story line in fabulous and leaves you on the edge of your seat with lots of fast paced action. I highly recommend the whole series. There are several adult situations including sexual encounters and assault.Adult read.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I normally read series books but decided to take a chance and boy am I glad this was a great book and I hope that maybe it will lead to a series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This book was awful compared to the pre-quel &#34;Bonded&#34;. The point of view was from a daytime soap opera. The hero/heroine and plot were ALL so lame, this book made a 1980's episode of General Hospital look compelling.",1
B00BTIDW4S,I love these series. I had this book on my nook. I had to buy for my kindle. I brought the others too.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I really had a good time reading  &#8220;The Mating  &#8221;.  It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author.  As a matter of fact I have read the whole series.  Please go out a either donate to your local animal shelter, or volunteer like me.  It is very rewarding to help these creatures who are in a shelter for no fault of there own.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I love this story. It has so much suspense love and violence that I couldn't even put the book down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Way to go Nicky Charles! Whole series is free. Nicky chooses to share the love for writing while asking us to play it forward with sharing.I had actually read the second book first. So far, Nicky writes each story so you don't have to read each in order. Characters that are introduced in first book have a complete different story lines in next book. Same with life. Same people, different day. I feel Nicky did not rewrite the first book into the second one like so many other authors have a tendency to do with series.Interesting how author chooses to use different spelling for the same word over and over again. Like the 2nd book, found myself skipping over a couple area's of the book trying to get to the jest of the chapter. With that being said, still an entertaining read. Love triangles, mystery, deceit, jealousy, hot male werewolves and more. Would recommend this book and now I'm going to download the 3rd book in the series. Happy reading!",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Throughout most of this book I thought I was caught up in watching a Jim Carrey comedy sequel"" dumb and dumbest""  the male lead was dumb and the female lead was dumbest. I dislike a female lead to be so dense.  I am not expecting a Nancy drew crime solver but I am not expecting her to be so lost either, l was hoping for  more from her and I was so disappointed when she fell so short of the smarts  department.",2
B00BTIDW4S,Stayed up to the early hours of the morning to finish this book. It was so good I didn't want to put it down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Soooooo where to start? Ok let's say short review, the book is a nonstop interest keeper from the first to the last page! ;) long version from the first sentence your snared, then strung along a nonstop emotional roller coaster in your mental bookstate of personal interest in these characters and their story. There's  sadness, remorse, hurt, sexiness, anticipation, anxiety, drama drama and oh drama, splash on some anger, relief a couple eye brow raises then throw in a dash of happiness and contentment due to the way the story progresses and the characters unfold at the perfect rate of just enough the entire way to keep you on the edge of the couch, bed, chair and or car lol ( ( I read in a lot of places) All and all GREAT READ! ENJOY I KNOW I DID! Mander's Out!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a fantastic book!  Kept you guessing till the end! I would recommend for adults! 5 starts! Action and romance!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have had this book for a while and just never opened it to read. At the time I was reading another series. Well I have been missing out... these books by Nicky Charles are gems! The story is written to pull you in, as if you are right there seeing it..",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Okay so in the beginning I was a little peeved but after that it was a spectacular read. SO loved it,.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really enjoyed this story. It is the first time I have read anything by Nicky Charles, but it will definitely not be the last.There were so many things that I like about this story. I loved the MCs and I loved the suspense. It was very well written and it flowed really well which made it easy to read.I felt as though we really got to know Elise and Kane, which made it easier for me to enjoy their tale. We, as readers, really got to see their relationship start to grow, and there is so much more for us to get to know about these two.I could not imagine starting my marriage off in the same manner as poor Elise and Kane, but they both managed to make the most of the situation.As I said before I enjoyed the suspense. Not because I was wondering who did it, because that was pretty obvious. The reason I enjoyed it is because it added more layers to the story and basically the plot centered around how the things that were happening affected Kane and Elise's relationship and the relationship that she may or may not have with the rest of the pack.I will be looking forward to reading more books by this author and I am happy to discover that I actually have the next book in the series. I got them when they were free on Amazon, but if I hadn't I would still go out and buy the next book. I have a need to know how this saga is going to play out.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Excellent plot!  Elise and Kane's story was romantic and sexy.  An enjoyable read that kept you wanting more.  Recommend for mature readers.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I loved it. I loved the first one too so now I will be moving on to number three and can't wait!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"It was intense, lovely, funny, exciting, it was hard to put the ebook down, to do my stuff, it was like a adrenaline coming over me, loved it",5
B00BTIDW4S,"The start of a wonderful serials. I became a BIG fan of his after this book! As a long time reader (over 40 years) it is hard for me not to know what's going to happen with a story, but he is the first author (since early Stephen King) when I don't see something coming!! It is so refreshing to be shocked or not guess what is going to happen in a story. I have read all so far in this serials and I have told every reader I know about you, you have not disappointed me yet!! Keep me not knowing the ending. Love it!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is the second book I read of the series and I liked it as much as the first one.I enjoyed the positive thinking the author used for Elise's character and the development of the relationship after a difficult beginning. I am looking forward to the next books,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Took my chances on this free book & I must say that it's the Best free book I have ever read & the best werewolf novel I have read. This thriller was killing me,  who was sabotaging the woods? Why ? I love how Elise and Kane became close!!!! A must read!!!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed the storyline overall but felt like ti fell apart towards the end. There is a scene where bad Marla calls good Elise a nitwit and I couldn't agree more. It's just hard to imagine any woman mated to an Alpha as so stupid, dense and gullible. At one point her life is threatened, she meets a rogue stranger and wonders if she should finger comb her hair and straighten her jacket - oh yeah at the time she has a broken leg, can't walk and a homicidal maniac coming after her at any minute. And her thoughts are on finger combing her hair. There are a lot of threads in this story and Ms. Charles tried to wrap them up at the end but it fell short. And what was it with Elise coming on to Ryne while thinking about Kane, and when he responds its Ryne's fault? There was a weird chemistry between Ryne and Elise at the end that left one wondering about Elise, and I don't think that was the intention. Well, I think this is Ms. Charles first book in this series so some slack can be cut. I still think a writer can have plot, mystery, love, and tension without the main character being a dimwit.",4
B00BTIDW4S,It was very hard to put this book down so i could go to sleep each night. I am definitley a werewolf romance fan now!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this book, was my favorte out of the whole serise that was wrote so far. I enjoyed it and would give it a full FIVE Stars! I would recommend any of this serise! I cant wait to see if there will be more or not!Love me some Alpha Werewolfs! hehe",5
B00BTIDW4S,"There was just enough mixture of sex and story. Not so you da in love with the main characters, but also so many of the supporting characters. I'm anxious to start the next book, The Bonding.",4
B00BTIDW4S,A second in the series of lycans. I read this book several years ago and enjoyed it just as much the second time.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I just finished reading the the bonding. This one was even better. I could not put it down. This is a good story line with very strong characters, it grabs you and sucks you in!.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles is a great author, she spins a great story that keeps you glued to the pages. Making it impossible to put the book down. I stayed up reading all night, I just couldn't put it down.Thanks Nicky.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Like the book suggests, there is sex. Lots of graphic hot steamy sex. The story itself is okay, that's it. A lot of frustrating scenes where the main characters are idiots and keep things to themselves instead if being honest.",2
B00BTIDW4S,I started this book early morning finally just finished it I loved the whole story kept  you wondering what was going to happen next. Hope there is a second book in the future..,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Finished this book in record time.  Couldn't put it down.  You became so involveIn the story, it was like you were there.  The love scenes were romantic,sexy,& exciting.Looking forward to the rest of the Lycans.",5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this entire series and can't wait for more.  Each story focuses on a different set of characters.  Very good read!!!!,5
B00BTIDW4S,This one is my favorite out the series. Elise is such great heroin she doesn't take anyone's crap but at the same time she's quite but watching and listening. Kane is just a everyday type of guy and you can't help but go FINALLY when these 2 fall for each other. :-),5
B00BTIDW4S,"Okay, let me start by saying this book, in fact the whole series, was free. The author only asks that the reader consider making a donation to their local animal shelter or food bank, which is pretty awesome when you think about it. And now for the book...I had actually read this one once before, and enjoyed it both times. It was a bit frustrating at times that the lead female was so naive, but she was young and had likely had a sheltered life.The villain was very believable, and there was a bit of a twist at the end which really surprised me. The romance aspect was sweet and occasionally steamy. Kane was a lovely example of Alpha Male, but should listen to his mate more often.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles has a talent for making the life of a werewolf dangerously sexy and romantic, the story of Kane and Elise is one of young love fraught with miss understandings and the struggle to build a life with a mate you don't even know.  Read on and ride the discovery of first time love with a perfect stranger, enjoy.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"After reading Bonded and Betrayed I could not wait to read The Mating and I was not disappointed.In The Mating you have Kane and Alpha willing to make an alliance through a mating for the good of his pack and Elise the daughter of the Alpha from the second clan.Elise feel betrayed by her father who knew her feelings for Bryan. Now she finds herself mates to a stranger and when she arrives at her new pack, she finds out all kinds of things that have her befuddled and who is this Marla?Read on and enjoy another great book by Nicky Charles!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Very nice read, bit of heartbreak, love, werewolves, sexysexy, intrigue and the villainess had plenty of OMFG SHE DID WHAT moments. This series has got me hooked, and not just because I got them all free either. And as this was free, I truly appreciate the author not only giving her work away, as she's very talented and weaves a good story, but in her afterwords, she asks donations be made to either an animal charity or a food bank. What a sweetheart! And yes, I have done both.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I love this story! Love, romance, and suspense all rolled in one.  The closeness of the pack is heart warming.",5
B00BTIDW4S,While I very much enjoyed this story I still was waiting on that little bit more of heat between the hhs.  This is why I only have it 4 stars it almost seems like parts had been left out of the story line..but all in all its an enjoyable read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"Again, great story. Loved it and ready for more.  Fantastic imagery. I will hate to finish the series. If you enjoy this kind of story, you will love Nicky s books.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I got this book as a kind of hunch. However,I was surprised that it really kept me interested in a subject I would not normally like. It was well written with some irony involved.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"All I can say is another great Lycan book. Great story, more intrigue. On to the next book in this series.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This was a sweet love story with moments of action.  Elsie abilities to put two and two together was at times annoying.  I wished we had more insight of Marla's character.  Overall I enjoyed the story.,3
B00BTIDW4S,The loyalty among the wolves is fasinating except for Marla of  course.  I never would have believed Rose would have done what she did either.  Kane was great and every woman's dream.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"The storyline is such that I wanted to read it without putting it down; however, the heroine got on my nerves. Not too smart, that one.",4
B00BTIDW4S,It was one of those mysteries that I had partially figured out already but still some surprises.  A good read n hope there will b another book with the new pack,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I thought that it was an interesting read, lots of action and the ending wasn't obvious.  The epilogue makes you want to read the next book.",5
B00BTIDW4S,This is very different from anything I have ever read before but I really enjoyed it and look forward to more.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I can't say enough about these stories and this author - love everything about the stories and characters.  I can't put these books down.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Nicky Charles is a rare breed, pun intended. It is rare that such a talented author requires no payment for the purchase of their books, and instead requests that the buyer makes a donation instead, an animal shelter in Ms. Charles' case. Not to mention she is quite accessible and friendly. You can send her fan mail and she will personally reply with a kind response. All of the above are major brownie points, however, this is a book review so let's get on with it.I admit I have come across The Law of the Lycan series before while late night browsing, and I am ashamed to say that I ignored them. However, for some reason I decided to click on her Bonded book after reading the summary, and I was hooked. I purchased the rest of the series and let's just say I am not disappointed, AT ALL. After reading Bonded, I was starving for more, so I began reading The Mating, and it temporarily sated my hunger.First of all, The Mating is written beautifully. The vocabulary Ms. Charles uses is tasteful and sophisticated not juvenile, and the plot is amazing. The book flows beautifully and the characters are very well-rounded and deep, it's like they have their own real-life souls; they could jump out of the book at any  moment and you would have no trouble believing that they are real people. I have to warn you though, there are one or two curse words, which I think is great, because both young adults and adults alike can read and enjoy this book just the same.I love how Ms. Charles focuses on plot and character development instead of sex, although the sex scenes are very steamy and enjoyable!I could go on and on singing praises on how I loved this book, so go on and read it for yourself!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"Steamy sex scenes, lots of twists and turns and more action than you could hope for! I definitely will be buying the next book!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I enjoyed this book and I look forward to the sequel. I started reading and didn't stop till the last page was read,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I liked this story better that bonded.  I had a better understanding of what the author common knowledge when she wrote and I was not quite as confused with what I thought was jumping around in the story.  This is a very classic storyline finding love between characters. I liked the plot, Kane our hero and Elise.  She was mated to someone  outside her pack, struggling to find her norm in this group with her new mate.  I cannot wait to read the next book in this series. I have gotten first three free and I like that.",4
B00BTIDW4S,At first I was hesitant to try this book out....1) it was about werewolves2) i was worried it was one of those that had an abrupt ending forcing you to pay for the second book to 'finish' the storySURPRISINGLY i was hooked...I couldnt put the book down!i fell in love with werewolves... i loved Kane (the hero) and the heroine albeit got on my nerves a few times.. the love story between them two made me stay up late to finish it!i ended up buying all the other books.. all related to each other but do not need to read every book to understand what is going on!definitely recommend Nicky Charles book to everyone out there!,5
B00BTIDW4S,One word......Wicked! I don't usually read outside the vampires and ghost especially anything that has to do with wolves but you bet your a$$ I'll read anything that you put out. This story started out slowly but I enjoyed the ten hours it actually took me to read it. If the book is good it would take me a couple of days to read and if it's great it would take me a couple of hours. Your story was fantastic! You have officially been dipped in awesome sauce! Can't wait to read more!,5
B00BTIDW4S,Love this series. Never a dull moment. Can't wait to read the next book. Still blown away by the author's generosity.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I thought this book was a nice change of pace. I will look for other books by this author. Thanks,5
B00BTIDW4S,"A friend recommended this book and since it was free I thought why not. The story was relatable but lacked passion. I needed more history about the werewolves.  Their beginning what separates them from other species. There were no lycan references as well, hopefully the next book will have more information and be less dull.",3
B00BTIDW4S,Great read. Heart warming and action packed. There is never a chance for a reader to lose interest.Always looking to see what will happen next.,5
B00BTIDW4S,WOW I LOVED this book it was fantastic read! I have really come across books that I didn't really think I would enjoy...step out of the box and enjoy this one please. I am happy I did.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I LIKED THE BOOK, the story line. Wished the happy couple had  kids before the ending. Looking forward to the next book about the brother and friends in Canada.Iowa",3
B00BTIDW4S,I was not sure about this book but thought I would give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I did like it.  The person causing the  issues give the book more drama and works with the conflict of the characters.  This shows that even WerePeople have issues when dating/mating. Very good read.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"I'm glad I read the prequels first, because I might not have moved on to the rest of the books in this series.  When I started reading this book, I immediately recognized it as a novice writers first crack in the literary world.  There are serious time line and story planning issues.  A screen might be described as a week ago only to later back track into it only happening a day ago.  This happened more than it should have.  Which leads me to believe that she changed direction in her story line and for got to edit changes through out the book.  The constant description of the hero is an ear maker for authors used to submitting weekly/monthly chapters to an amateur writing site.  Plus, the pace of the story was incredibly slow and for some reason the hero and heroine act like 13 year olds passing 'Do you like me? Yes or no' notes.  I get being oblivious to another person's feelings, but COME ON!  After spend half the night sexing each other up, usually someone starts to ask where this relationship is going.  I mean, seriously.Humph...  That being said, besides everyone being asiningly stupid, the story had potential.  And the later stories are much much better.  Why someone would include a one side phone conversation when it's the heroine speaking is beyond me.So I will continue reading and try to understand we're these prequel stories fit in.",2
B00BTIDW4S,"I enjoyed the story, with the interaction of werewolf and human traits being brought together in a community setting. The world of imagination bring a werewolf to life.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Sorry line started slow but in the end I enjoyed it. looking forward to reading the next one. always enjoy finding new authors.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I read all 5 of the books by Nicky Charles. I felt they were interesting and fast paced.  I would certainly read more by her.  I am always in search of free books to read because I read a lot.  I would recommend this series.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I love shifter books. This series is great. Elise is a young female who is mated to Kane a man she doesn't know.  She thinks she is in love with Bryan.  Kane takes her to his pack where she tries to fit in and find her place.  Marla is the evil witch who tries to stop Elise and Kane from falling in love.  Kane and Elise do fall in love and fight the evil Marla.  Lots of loving and fighting.,5
B00BTIDW4S,The story of Elise and Kane stole my heart immediately and kept me captivated the entire time.  I commend Miss Charles for her view on Lycans and how she handles this series as a whole.  I love the characters. I feel like I know them. I love that she keeps the stories centered around so many individuals and it changes from one point of view to another with each book. Elise and Kane are my favorites.,5
B00BTIDW4S,I thought for a free ebook it would be so so. However; I am greatly impresses!  PLEASE GIVE TO ASAPCA,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I really knew nothing about werewolves but this book was a great read - excellent plot, well written, kept my attention; sensitive characters and plot that kept moving.  One of the few books I was riveted to and anxious to see what would happen. Very different.",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I loved this book, Nicky Charles brought all of the characters to life and kept my on the edge of my seat! I will be looking for anything else written by him!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"very good suspense novel. some of the plot was predictable and you wonder how the heroine could be so stupid, but then some great twists come into play and the the plot thickens. I loved the characters and would like to see their lives played out in other books.",4
B00BTIDW4S,"I read alot of paranormal books and am always on the lookout for new authors, this one is def on my list now!  I don't like to go on and on about the characters and the stories, spoiling the books for others like some reviewers but I will say that this is not the tired, done and re-done werewolf books!  Refreshing author!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"I found this book to be a real page tuner right from the beginning and it never disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I felt that the only downfall in this book was that I prefer to have the sex a little watered down. It was quite explicit, but outside of that the book was fantastic.",5
B00BTIDW4S,Love the book can't wait to read more of miss Charles's books.She puts a new spin on paranormal romance,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very good love story of Westwood it's good to know that money is the root of all evil will tell everyone to read,4
B00BTIDW4S,I loved this story! I am an avid reader of fantasy and this is my first time reading Nicky Charles. I can hardly wait to start the next book. Thank-you.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Wonderfully hot shifter story! Made me want to read more in the series!!! Read it in one day! Can't wait to get the next one!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a good read it kept my attention. Love the hero he wasn't to in your face alpha. I liked that he had a blind spot and a reasonable excuse for having it. The only drawback for me was the heroine. I know she was supposed to be young and naive but there is naive and then there is stupid. Her habit of seeing suspicious going ons, reasoning them suspicious and the putting it off for later had me skipping pages. When dealing with her character, I had to keep reminding myself  that this was fiction and her stupidity was needed to move the story along. All said the heroine was the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars, I can't stand wussy females.",4
B00BTIDW4S,The story started out a little slow but once it got going I could not stop reading it! It has unexpected twists and turns. I definitely recommend this book as a must read!,4
B00BTIDW4S,This is the first werewolf book I've read and I loved it.  It was a really touching love story. I will definitely read more from this author.,4
B00BTIDW4S,"For me, these books stand out in the werewolf romance genre as great books. Each book in this series is worth your time and your donation to charity. Download now!",5
B00BTIDW4S,I found myself rooting for things to work out with Elise and knew that Marla was the troublemaker.  I wonder if Marla will turn up again....,4
B00BTIDW4S,"If you like a sweet romance with a little turmoil thrown, then you'll love this book.  The whole premise of the book, werewolfs living in packs among the general population, has many connotations to real life.  The author created a strong bond between the reader and the characters.  This was a quick read.  I'm so happy that there is a follow up book.  I hope it contains these same characters that I love!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"This was a good book. I really liked the story, and it was sexy a hell.  I would have given it more stars, but a lot of it was a bit too predictable for me, and the spelling/grammar mistakes drove me crazy... Still a good read :)",3
B00BTIDW4S,I so thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The two main characters were very strong characters.  I am very glad that Ryan was found to be innocent of the charges that they tried to frame him with and look forward to reading about him and his pack.  Would definitely recommend this book to friends.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Very different.  Suspenseful.  Quick reads.  I didn't want to put the book down.  It had a lot of different turns.,4
B00BTIDW4S,I really enjoyed this book my only complaint is I would have liked to get a better understanding from Kanes perspective.  I found the story so engaging I completed the book in two days.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a very talented writer, capable of providing irresistible twists and turns to keep the reader reading! Most impressive and gratifying is that she shares her talent at no cost, asking only that her audience contribute to the local animal shelter or food bank instead!I especially appreciate the message she encourages of tolerance and acceptance of diversity. It's a creative way to make the point, without being preachy or self-righteous. As a mixed race female, I empathize with the issue and enjoy the innovative way the author instantiates such a real, volatile social issue. Her analogy is spot on!If I had to find fault with the books, it would be the extensive erotica. I understand why she uses such detail; to provide the reader with the extent of the characters' passion and ""connection,"" but it's a bit too much for my taste. I'm not sure if she could have achieved the same result with less, however, I found it distracted too much from the plot and the other ""action"" in the story.Overall, a fantastic series that I have begun reading again! I think I read it out of order, so I'm starting over. I think ""Betrayed: Days of the Rogue"" was supposed to follow ""The Mating."" Since it didn't say in the title like the rest of the books, I read it last. But no matter, I'm enjoying the second round! :)I hope there is a final chapter to this series, as several questions are left unanswered: Does Damien fall in love again? What happens with The Purists? Who's their leader? Who sent those threatening letters? Who killed Damien's wife? Does Kane take over the pack he sent Damien to monitor? I can't wait to find out!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Like I've  said before this author has an awesome imagination and this story is just as good as the one before. It's very deep and is very climactic with sensually descriptive love scenes between the characters in between that make you not want to put it down until the end! THE ENTIRE SERIES IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!,4
B00BTIDW4S,I am enthralled with these stories. Cant wait to read the next. Nicky Charles gives us the back stories of each of the characters from the prequel to the Mating. Plus the author gives these books free asking for a simple donation to your favorite animal shelter or food bank. It makes me love this author all the more. Read people. It'll be a favorite of yours too!,5
B00BTIDW4S,This is even better than the the twilight series. I found the characters totally  believable.  I recommend this one. Truly!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"What a surprising book--caught me up in the storyline from page one.  The book has everthing--evil, good, fantasy, hot sex, and twists and turns galore.  Very entertaining!",5
B00BTIDW4S,"What an amazing read.... if lycans are to your taste then you cannot go past this series... I could not put down this second book in the series either.Great story line, strength of characters, leadership, deception, lust at its best.A twist you wont see coming until the very end!Strong bond between mates, family and the pack.A must read!",5
B00BTIDW4S,Lots of detail and a good story. Would recommend it to friends to read. ......will check out other books by the author,5
B00BTIDW4S,"Just finished reading ""The Mating"" and enjoyed it immensely! It was filled with excitement and suspense. The characters were well developed and believable. Thank you for making it available on my Kindle for free.",4
B00BTIDW4S,The Mating was every bit as good as the Bonding. It followed logically but also could easily be read without being familiar with the bonding.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I have a thing for fantasy books and this one about werewolves did it for me.I liked it a lot! Elise hears she is going to be mated to the alpha of another pack just a few hours before their wedding. While she just wanted to asked her father if she could mate with her best friend. But Kane is even more man (and werewolf) than her friend.Elise has to leave her own pack to stay with her new mate and his pack. Most of his pack like her, but there is one woman who plays tricks with Elise. Of course Kane is a man and doesn&#8217;t see it and protects the other woman.A book about mating but also with suspense because of all the bad things happening with Kane&#8217;s pack.Great read, would love to read more from this writer.",4
B00BTIDW4S,This is a great love/ suspense  story. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I actually ordered this book because of the opposing viewpoints. The reviewer who said it had ""rape"" went a bit overboard. Come on. It's fantasy! Werewolf laws can be different than ours. If you want to play by our rules, then stick to crime fiction and mysteries.I actually thought it was pretty good and I most likely will read more of Nicky Charles' books. So...Nicky - keep it up! I can't wait to see what you will think up next.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Your books give me a great way to live vicariously! I'd recommend the series to anyone who likes to dream!,5
B00BTIDW4S,"I had read some really good reviews about this book, and it was FREE so I decided to try it out. Considering it was free that made me view it a little more highly than if I had paid for it. The story is about Elise being forced to mate with the Alpha of another pack to keep the pack's alliance. She doesn't know this Alpha at all, and he doesn't know anything about her, but they are quickly thrown together to mate. And then as soon as they mate she's forced to leave her home and friends behind to move to his territory.I enjoyed the story to this book, it was very interesting. And I liked Elise's character, she was very brave even though her whole life was changing she was still trying to make due with what she had. And she wanted to do her duty for her pack by mating with the Alpha she didn't know.Throughout the book I didn't really get a grasp on Kane's personality or emotions. He seemed almost like a void to me even though he was a round a lot. And I truly hated the fact that ""Marla"" had Kane wrapped around her finger. It made me think way less of Kane, and it also made me dislike the book. I can not stand books where the women has the man believing something that's not true it really bugs me when these kinds of character's are thrown into a story because I absolutely hate them!! So that is why I'm saying this book is only okay. It wasn't that long either, so if your looking for a werewolf story to pass the time but not leave a huge impression I recommend this book.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"This story wasn't too poorly written, although the author seemed to drive the point home and repeat a bit too often (rather than allowing the reader to draw conclusions from events, desired conclusions would be recapped, as though we couldn't have understood).  The characterization was excellent, and Elise was believable.  I want to make it clear that this is not 'a bad book' in that sense.Unfortunately, this story just drips with misogyny.  The werewolf culture described isn't just 'backward,' socially; it's medieval.  The 'alpha,' and all of the others in charge, are male.  The 'alpha female's' job is to cook and arrange gatherings (no joke).  Arranged marriages are still a norm.  Females are expected to be virgins until they're married (mated), and proof of their virginity is actually examined on their wedding night.Despite having access to the internet and presumably a modern education, the main character acknowledges the 'backward' traditions, but then goes on to NOT REALLY QUESTION THEM.  She goes along with an arranged marriage because she's too timid to leave the pack.  At one point, her mate actually rapes her (she said no, very clearly, regardless of any bodily reactions), and afterward, she's worried about HIS feelings - that he didn't like her.  Ugh...The intrigue and murder mystery were okay, but the primary issue I had with them was the fact that I already knew who was responsible for the problems, less than halfway through the book.Not a poorly written book.  Good worldbuilding.  Good characterization.  Just not the type of culture or mentality that I enjoy seeing portrayed as normal or okay.  (You can't blame it on their being wolves, either - 60% of wild wolf packs are led by females, so all that sexual segregation and misogyny is purely human).",3
B00BTIDW4S,"This is a standard genre storyline, reasonably competently written. It shows a lot of promise; it would have been a great read with one more round of editing. For instance, the author can't seem to decide whether her heroine is a pampered princess type who needs to learn self-sufficiently or a tough, no nonsense girl who needs to learn to trust. More annoyingly, the denouement contains one character whose actions are against type and no explanation is given for their actions.  In fact, the author literally has her characters say &#34;I guess we'll never know why that happened.&#34;  I've definitely read worse, but there's lots of better books in this genre.",3
B00BTIDW4S,"I thought the story line was pretty good but chaotic in certain places. I would have liked the relationship between the two main characters to be lengthen over a longer period of time before the serious problems occurred.  Besides that and a few other issues, the book  was pretty good.",4
B00BTIDW4S,Wow.This book was so good and engaging that I found it extremely hard to put down. I would strongly recommend reading this series to everyone who enjoys reading and those that don't.,5
B00BTIDW4S,Love the story line.  The brother bond is a great family go getter.  There love for each other was great to see within this love story.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Quick read , I Can't wait for the next book, and I really hate to waitTill the 2nd part will release I'll need to re-readif you're looking for some sizzlin sex this is the book",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Amazingly hot, sexy, and funny. Love this short story and can't wait for the next portion. Please don't make us wait long. A must read.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"It's ok, quite short! 3.5",3
B00JDYC5OI,Holy cliffhanger!!! NO!!! I usually dislike serials and cliffhangers but this was so awesome. I'm hoping the author doesn't make us wait too long. This was excellent!  And this was the author's first &#34;erotic&#34; romance?  BRAVO!  I love everything she's written so far and this one is a naughty dirty  little gem and I want more. Bring it on :) Readers buy this you won't be sorry!,5
B00JDYC5OI,I love how their friendship starts over the phone and develops into more without actually meeting. I can't wait to read the next book!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"It was just okay for me, I found it hard to connect with the characters, too abrupt and cold, so I won't be reading the next installment.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"All I can think right now is &#34;gimme gimme gimme!&#34;  I want...no I NEED book two right now!!  Come to think of it, this story, this novella is the first I've given 5 stars to.  I steer clear of them typically.  I'm also usually a bit harder on them only because you don't have the full story, they tend to be choppy, a beginning, middle and no end.  NOT this novella.  Nope Reasonable Doubt is just about perfect!Wow I said perfect LOL.  Even the synopsis was perfect for this book.  I mean come on, who isn't sold with, &#34;My cock has an appetite.&#34;? I giggle every single time I read it.  For real....giggle.  I'm happy to report that it lives up to that sentence and gives you even more.  I'm not going to rehash anything because the it's too small of a book.  By the time I tell you what it's about you could have read it.I will say that the sexual tension, the innuendo, the passion, the sordidness it epic.  I haven't felt this way about an erotic novel/novella in a long time.  Andrew, or should I call him Thoreau, is hands down one of the most arrogant male characters I've read.  He's so beyond confident all I could was shake my head at him.  Plus he's funny, sexy, gorgeous, frankly there isn't much NOT to love about the guy.  With the exception of course that he doesn't do relationships.  Aubrey, aka Alyssa, is just about his equal in her confidence.  She's able to spar with him like no other.  Her ability to light a fire under Andrew makes for some very very steamy scenes!&#34;And when you come back,&#34; I added, &#34;just leave my afternoon coffee on that bookshelf and walk out.  Don't come anywhere near my desk and don't say anything to me.&#34;&#34;Why not?&#34;&#34;Because I'll f&*$ you again if you do.&#34; She blushed and stepped out of the room.I'm thoroughly impressed with this novella.  I cannot wait for volume two!",5
B00JDYC5OI,The story was very hot. I loved it! I can't wait for the next two to come out! Should have waited to all three were ready :-/ the only downfall is that it is short and you will want the next book as soon as you finish this one so it might be wise to wait until all three are out ;-) I can't wait! So good!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"i don't even read this type book but I do now.  I loved the characters, the story and the personal why she brings you into the mindset of the character.I have book #2 and can't believe I have to wait on the next one.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I am not a fan of novella series, but if all novellas are going to be like this one, they might become my favourite.Wow, this book has EVERYTHING-intersting storyline, lovable characters and hot sex! Can`t wait for the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Whitney Garcia Williams&#8217; Reasonable Doubt had me by the first line of the product description.  The characters of Alyssa and Andrew were so well drawn.  I got such a kick out of his point of view, though hers was a bit less entertaining.  But by the end&#8212;and that damned cliffhanger (but who am I to complain about that)&#8212;I was dying for more.",5
B00JDYC5OI,This is the first book of Whitney Gracia Williams that I have read and it definitely wont be the last. I really loved this first part and cannot wait for the second part to come out. I need the second part like yesterday!! Wow! Although it is only short it is sexy and oh so hot!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"If you are not a fan of serial writing or cliffhangers, DO NOT READ!  I love the serial books. They are a like a small little soap opera that plays out every few weeks and then you get a new book.  Downfall is, you have to wait for those books and pay for each and every one (these tend to be my filler books in between other books since they are short and can be read in an hour or so).This book we are introduced to our 2 main characters, Aubrey (aka Alyssa) and Andrew (aka Thoreau) who are presumably lawyers that meet through an &#34;online lawyer chat room&#34;.  They've never met, but have been talking and texting for months and have built some sort of virtual relationship.  A relationship that Andrew never set out for since he is a &#34;one and done&#34; sort of guy.  Could that change and if so, change their future?  You have to read the first in this short novella series to find out.I liked the characters.  I liked the sexual undertones, as well as the overt playfulness with the characters.  Curious what will come next and how that will change what's to come with their friendship and lies.  Cliffhangers be damned!  But an oh so good one.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Very hot! I love this book. I wish it was much longer but I can't wait for the second one! You will fall in love with these characters!,5
B00JDYC5OI,All I can say is wait until all three books are released becuase otherwise you will be me right not having read the first one and waiting not so patiently for the next two to come out! Love the story it was raw and mysterious and I just want the other two to come out!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I had no idea it would be a book that would continue to more then 1 otherwise I would have waited to purchase it. I will say that I loved the story and the characters , looking forward to the next books I hope they get her ASAP . Lol",5
B00JDYC5OI,Andrew Hamilton is hot hot hot! This is one of the best books I have read in a long time!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Different story line...and strong female character. Stronger then most....he is a prick.. nothing new there.Story was just heating up when it ended. NOT sure I will finish series.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"I get the hype now. Goodness, I GET IT! Excellent job by the author to draw the reader in with such a short part one. Super excited that she doesn't delay in publishing the follow up. Thank you for that!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I liked this book I really liked this book it's not 5stars because it left me wanting more I have to buy the next two just to get my Answers,4
B00JDYC5OI,I loved it . If u like beautiful bastard you'll love reasonable doubt. Stay tuned for the cliffhanger. But so loved it.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I normally don't read novellas. Nothing against them, I'm just an instant gratification kinda chick. I like this story. It has the sexy, which is no nonsense and straightforward. It also has a story, I am intrigued to find out what made Andrew the way he is and what will Aubrey do next. I can't wait to keep reading.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I normally get mad at these short novels but I really enjoyed it. funny, sexy and really enjoyable. I loved it!!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,I read this expecting more of the same...but the hilarious banter between the two characters before the hot stuff even started was fantastic. I can't wait for the next one & am already anticipating that this sassy mouth pair will not disappoint. I will definitely read more from this author. A great laugh & sexy story.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Just finished and my mouth is still on the floor.  I don't want to wait for the next one!  I need a cold shower.  That sums it up.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG! I think my new crush is Andrew Hamilton! Finished reading this book this morning! Great read! The only negative is that it ended right there & then!  Wanted more!!!! Need more, please!!!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,OMG!!! This book was SMOKING HOT!! I loved Andrew. Half A-hole and Half Alpha. He was perfect. Whitney sure knows how to keep us wanting more. Well played Whitney.,5
B00JDYC5OI,OMG! Uber good! Absolutely love it. She got right to the juicy. The end is an absolute shocker. CANNOT WAIT for the rest of the story. #AnxiouslyWaitingPatiently,5
B00JDYC5OI,"One word- whoa!! If you're looking for a good book with sizzling hot sex, this is it! Andrew Hamilton will make you forget all about that other guy..what's his name? Grey? I can't wait for the next book!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,This books is one of the best I read this year. The writer is very talented and I hope to see here writing something longer. A must read to all of you that love hot and sexy romance.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Very good read...I finished it in one sitting. Lies will always come back and bite you in the Ass!! These characters were good and strong. Good writing to keep you engaged in such a small amount of time!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Wow loved this book from start to finish I really need part 2 now ! I can't believe it ended like that seriously.  !,5
B00JDYC5OI,WTF just happened. Ugh I loved this book. I can't believe the cruel way this book ended. This book is one of those that you buy per character. I'm usually not a fan of these but my God this book was Hot. Great start,5
B00JDYC5OI,Absolutely loved this book... Am dying for the second one to come out...was suppose to be released today... Come on.. Come on...,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Dang it! A cliffhanger! I want to know more now, please.Well done, very enjoyable. Nice and hot! I'll be following along on this serial.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Do you like no holds barred sexy alpha men? Do you like a man that's shows toughness to protect his awesome heart? Then this book is for you! I can't wait for the next two installments!,5
B00JDYC5OI,I freaking LOVED this book!!!  The author has created some great characters and I can't wait to read the next book.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I just finished reading  Reasonable Doubt and I'm dying here.  I can't wait for book 2!  I love Andrew but I also want to slap the hell out of him, especially now since that awesome cliffhanger.  Whitney G you have my utmost devotion because it's been awhile since a book has got my attention like RD has and wanting the next book, like yesterday.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I just loved it. That is all. Usually I will wait for all the books in a series to be completed before I read them. Because, when I don't follow my own rule, I wind up just like I am now... longing for the next book to find out what happens next! It doesn't happen for me very often, so I also want to note that I was literally laughing out loud in some parts of this book. Very enjoyable, quick read!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Quick read want more can't wait for next one very steamy great story good writing hurry up with next nor that's some cliff hanger,5
B00JDYC5OI,the story line is great.I like the idea that it is not a biker or a CEO of a company..but the fact it is a lawyer story.some thing different.the writing is wonderful you can sink your teeth into their lives.I so can't wait for the next book.keep them coming I will read everyone.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was a quick read but it didn't feel like it... Because I actually got to care about the characters!! I normally Don't even read a short book, but I'm sooooo glad I did!!!! I'm hooked! If you want a book the has great chemistry and believable characters GET THIS BOOK! It does have a cliff hanger but I'm looking forward to reading MUCH more from this new (to me:p) author!! Her writing if smooth and she really makes you live the story.. LOVED IT!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was Hot Hot Hot. Andrew is one sexy lawyer, Aubrey is a prelaw intern student. Nice hot fire going on between them. Loved it from start to finish, can't wait for next book to come out...",5
B00JDYC5OI,This story was sooo good and hot.  I can't wait for book two to come out.  Great story line.. Well written...,5

B00JDYC5OI,Wow this book is so hot. It should have a warning on it..I wouldn't suggest reading it in public. It definitely made my toes curl in delight!! I am patiently yet impatiently waiting for rd2 and 3. I swear my obsession with Andrew has turned into stalking whitney g's fb and author page. Thank you whitney for your amazing craft!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is the first book I've read by Whitney G. and I have to say I FREAKING LOVED IT!!! I can't wait for the second part. The twist at the end...awesome!!! The story was short but balanced. The writing just flowed. Start to finish, it was great. He hates liars, she lies by omission.  But then he.... Don't want to spill the surprise but let's just say...practice what you preach! Read this serial! Thanks Whitney G. Can't wait for Part 2!",5
B00JDYC5OI,All I have to say to Ms. Whitney is that the next book needs to come out like yesterday! What an amazing read! Thank you!  You rock!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy Hell!! This was hot and delicious and wonderful and nothing less than what I expect from Whitney Gracia Williams. I can't believe I am going to say this, but &#34;Jonathan and Claire, you may have to move over for Aubrey and Andrew!!!&#34;This couple is sooooo erotic together, their verbal and text exchanges are just brilliant. Their physicality is enthralling! I am loving this story, but hating the brevity of the first novel....and that cliffhanger.I hope we are not left hanging for too long for the next part.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow! Whitney Garcia Wiliam&#8217;s writing keeps getting better and better. &#8220;Reasonable Doubt&#8221; is the first part in a three-part serial romance story, and let me tell you that once you start reading you are going to devour every word.The tale starts off with Andrew, a high powered attorney who likes to meet women on online dating sites. He is not one for relationships. Like the blurb reads &#8220;One dinner. One night. No repeats.&#8221; The only relationship is with &#8220;Alyssa&#8221; a friend who he has never met and only communicates with electronically. I love how, though they have never met, you can feel the chemistry. There is this sexy banter between them that, you know once they meet, it is going to be explosive.I don&#8217;t want to mention too much because you should read the book and discover it yourself. However, let me say a few last words. If you are a dancer, or enjoy the dancing art form, then you might enjoy this book. If you dreamed of becoming a dancer than you will relate to one of the characters. Now, like I said, I am not going to say too much but this character is feisty, talented, and I think a force to be reckoned with. You can&#8217;t help but love this character.This is a really quick read, and once you are done you are going to be dying for the next part of the series. Sexy, from page one, you will not get enough of this book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Read it in one sitting left me speechless just  staring at my Kindle !!!  The writing was awesome I love how the author was like no holds bar on the main character Andrew Hamilton he was dirty hot and you wanted to rip him from the Book at it page one well that's how I felt anyway !!! Loved how he spoke so honestly to his woman OMG it was like so wrong but it was Apollo incredibly hot like really you can't believe he say this things I love him and Aubrey so happy she's one of those heroines that doesn't take any of his carp and gives it right back to him.  And leaves him speechless like huh did she just say that to me .......it was great I cannot wait to read the continuation of their story seriously I'm so hooked,5
B00JDYC5OI,"there are no words. this was short, hot and a good ol' cliffhanger.  I need the second book like NOW!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow such sweet torture. Hot characters,witty dialogue, and some hot sexy scenes. This was my first experience reading Whitney Garcia Williams and she did not disappoint. It's not the  originality of the story that makes it great but the way she delivers, it just works like magic. It ended way too soon and I hate that I have to wait even longer for more, total tease :)~ Totally a quick steamy read.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I finally found an amazing author! Let me just say thank you....for writing a good and different story from what I've read thus far. I haven't written a five star review in weeks and I've hated it. I don't like writing bad reviews but I feel like its the least I can give back to the author after they spend their time on writing something. I owe them honesty...and I hope that they read my reviews and expand and better their craft!!!I absolutely loved this book...but I wish it would have been a bit longer.....Aubrey... I loved her...and Andrew...omg what a huge male reproductive organ!!!!! This man was infuriating but I loved him and I cannot wait to see what happens next....since I loved the dimension on this book I will buy more from this author happily!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I'll admit when I read the back I wasn't sure how it was going to all play out but I quickly learned and it all added up and made sense.I had been hearing great things about this book but I didn't read it right away.  I'm glad I finally took the chance to read it.  I enjoyed everything about it and wondered what would happen next.  This is my first book by Whitney and I have become a fan and I think you will too.Sadly, it is a short book so I was glad I had volume 2 waiting for me but now I have to wait for volume 3.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I liked this book...the HH is a little shallow...ok a lot shallow, but i will say that when all the pieces fall together my mouth was left wide open...i was scared for the H...and there is  cliff hanger...that leaves u wanting...all in all...i liked the book and i will read the second one...these end to quick though",4
B00JDYC5OI,"AHHH!!! This was so damn good. Sexy, scandalous and sinful. This is part one of a three part series and be warned it is only 78 pages. However, HOLY CRAP was this book smoking hot and so addictive. In all honesty, you will read this book in about an hour or less depending on how fast you read, however, it was worth every freaking minute! Whitney Garcia Williams created these characters that make you both love and hate them, all while drawing you deeper and deeper into the story.Andrew Hamilton has his rules and his routines, for reasons unknown at this point, and he expects the women he involves himself with to respect these rules. To be fair, he is 100% honest with them, but that does not change the fact that he is an arrogant, egotistical jerk. Oh he also is incredibly sexy and respects honesty (remember this tidbit) so you tend to over look his flaws.During the day Andrew is a high profiled lawyer, but at night he spends his time meeting women online in hopes of having one dinner, one night and a good sex. After that he never speaks to him again and moves on to his next conquest. However, more and more women have been lying in their profiles (really, someone actually lies on their dating profile?? &#60;&#8211; my attempt at sarcasm), and he&#8217;s hit a dry spell. Meanwhile, he does have one friend, Alyssa. He met Alyssa on a lawyer networking site and it has been strictly friendship (with a little dirty talk!) and they have never met in person. The more time he talks to her, the more he wants her. They flirt, they tease, they go back and forth in a sexual tension power struggle.And then there was Alyssa (which isn&#8217;t even her real name), who is very different than the person Andrew thinks she is. As the reader, I just knew the storm was brewing as I got to find out what was going on in her head. Remember how Andrew values honesty above all else, yeah well use your imagination at how he reacts when he learns the truth. Oh and he finds out in the most holy crap way. It was like I was watching a car crash in slow motion. It was cringe worthy as the events happened and there was nothing you could do to stop it.As &#8220;Alyssa&#8221; becomes his intern, the fun only just begins. The banter between these two characters was filled with innuendo and tension. It is impossible to read this book without anticipation of their coupling sitting in the pit of your stomach. This book was so freaking scorching hot. I don&#8217;t know if it was Andrew and the way he just took what he wanted, when he wanted with a &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a crap&#8221; attitude or if it was just the situation that heightened the sexual tension, but this book had me needing some water to cool myself down.So I told you this was a short one, but I also need to tell you it has a cliffhanger as well. It&#8217;s an OMG moment that leaves you salivating for the next installment, which will be coming out in the next few weeks. Although I don&#8217;t like comparing books, if you liked Night Owl, then you will see it has a similar &#8220;feel&#8221; to it. But rest assured the stories are completely different. It just has that type of naughtiness to it. I loved this &#8220;book&#8221; and cannot wait for the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"What can I say?!? I loved this book. I was fortunate enough to have received an ARC and I finished it in one sitting. The banter between Andrew and Aubrey was great. The text messages during the day were hysterical. I found myself laughing out loud through most of them. The chemistry between the two characters was off the charts and the sex was HOTT!!! For those who don't like cliffhangers, then you will be upset. I knew going into the story that it was a serial and the ending left me with my mouth hanging open. All I can say is that I can't wait for the next 2 books to come out. Hurry up Miss Williams so we can see what happens. :)",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Five super hot stars! From the very first word, I could not put this book down! I love the smart, successful, jerk types. What I enjoyed even more, was Aubrey's ability to not let Andrew intimidate her. The writing was excellent, and the chemistry was heart wrenching! This is a must read for sure!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I need more, does that tell you enough?  What a hit this has been.  So excited for the next installment!",5
B00JDYC5OI,This is a great story but again a cliffhanger and another two books.  As an avid reader and lover of this genre I get that sometimes it takes more then one book but it does get tiresome for us.  That being said I will complete this series.  Great characters!,5
B00JDYC5OI,I liked this book the characters were likeable. The story though predictable was worth the read. My only complaint is that it was TOO SHORT!!  I will read book two and then book three.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"This was the first book I've read from this author and I absolutely loved it. Not only were the sex scenes super hot, the story has spunk and humor, and I can't wait til number 2 comes out! I've been counting the days! I will definitely read more from this author!",5
B00JDYC5OI,If you're looking for a quick read with some sizzlin sex this is the book! Can't wait for the next book!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Ohmigod! I was so disappointed. This book had such great potential. It started out so well. &#34;Thoreau&#34; (Andrew) likes to meet his women online. He promises casual sex, one night only...and he hates liars. So your online profile better be who you really are.He meets &#34;Alyssa&#34; (Aubrey) online. However, it's a lawyer chatline. It's unusual for Thoreau but he becomes friends with Alyssa. They exchange numbers. Alyssa has quite a few secrets. But even knowing how much Thoreau hates liars she is confident that she will never meet him in person, despite his attempts to get in her pants.The way they actually meet is classic. Unfortunately it only goes downhill from there.The way Andrew treats Aubrey in the workplace is demeaning and completely unacceptable. He acts like he has the upper hand because she lied to him. Well, she lied to Thoreau, not her employers. Aubrey needs to visit the HR department stat. But does she do that? No. She's starry-eyed over the jerk. And if the cliffhanger is the truth then he's a complete hypocrite.But I won't be reading the next installment to find out.",2
B00JDYC5OI,Very enjoyed reading the book and can not wait for the following book coming soon. Love the storyline and characters.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"There is nothing that this woman writes I will not read, it could be a computer software instructional manual and she would make it sexy.  The hottest books these days are coming at us in serials, short novellas with 4 or 5 to a series.  I've read some of those and it takes a couple novellas to get down to business and give us a true romance.  This is clearly a mini series all on its own.  We are captivated by their odd relationship, mentoring with a side sexual frustration.  Obviously both hiding from something and neither willing to give too much away.  Their relationship is a secret, even to each other.  Fair warning this is a cliffhanger, the kind where your jaw drops and makes you swear loudly at Ms. Williams.  A quick read, done in an elliptical workout at the gym, and I'm ready for more.  Not sure I can make it until #2!  Next time I need to read in private with a glass of wine, this is a SEXY hot and heavy read.  I was given a copy for review.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Okay, with a blurb that starts out like that, how can you possibly pass up this book!  So I was on the subway reading this and was sitting next to a guy who was drinking a soda filled with ice.  As I was reading, I was so tempted to grab the soda and dunk it over my head.  Good gawd this book is hawt!  I am a staunch Whitney fan but damn, girl, you blew me away with Andrew!  He has got to be one of the sexiest dirty talkers I've seen.  I was engaged after only one page and fell down that rabbit hole into the story and didn't come up for air until I finished.  The pacing, the dialogue, the smexy times - all so, so wonderful.  There are not many authors who can nicely balance the in-your-face erotica along with the romance but with each book, Whitney nails it.  I was trying to figure out how she was going to end this part, what could she do and whoa!!! that came out of nowhere.  Okay, now I need part 2 please.  I have to say that I tend to shy away from serials.  I hate having to wait - I hate having to pay again and again just to get the remainder of the book - but when I saw it was Whitney I happily one-clicked and then stalked her web site trying to find out when part 2 will be released.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was so sucked in into this story and that ending really caught me by surprise!!! Now I need that second book. A great but too short read.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow! What a great start to this series. I absolutely love Andrew! He totally reminds me of another Drew...from the Tangled series.Andrew Hamilton, high power attorney, doesn't do relationships. He stalks online dating and social sites for his next one night stand. He meets fellow attorney, Alyssa, on a lawyer social site. They chat for the last six months becoming closer, even after she refuses to meet in person or attempt a more romantic relationship.Andrew obviously has some skeletons in his past that have shaped him into the straight up jerk he is. He refuses to see a woman more than once and loathes lies and liars. Alyssa has reasons for refusing to meet in person as well. When they accidentally meet and their true identities are revealed, passion prevails just before Andrew's past surfaces.I cannot wait for the next episode!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I can't wait for the second book. Very well written. Keeps you glued the whole time, not to mention very hot and sexy!",5
B00JDYC5OI,No other words can tell you how I feel about this book. Just wish the next one would be out like yesterday!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Wow....a must read...I can just feel his body language...all sex...and Andrew is just looking for the next person to give it to..then along comes Aubrey....Andrew finally gives into his sexual needs for Aubrey....when now his Wife shows up....can't wait now to read the next  book....what a page turned...great writing Whitney.,5
B00JDYC5OI,a very good and hot read. something different about it that captures you! loved it but hated the ending to it,4
B00JDYC5OI,this book is not just filled with sex. there is humour and the chemistry between the hero and the heroine is palpable. i could not put it down and even though i had to wake up the next morning at 5:50 am i finished the book and went to bed at 2 am.really good !!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"i am an avid reader but i hardly give a book 5 stars. this book was absolutely fantastic. there is so many books out there nowadays that are full of sex and a mediocre story, well reasonable doubt isnt one of them. the story sucks you in and when its over you are left thinking wth did just happen?? those are the books that deserve 5+ stars!! cant wait for the next book!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Hot cocky hot shot lawyer. Young eager smart law sudent.  This book had me sold at the blurb and did not disappoint. Looking forward to the next book. Left us with one of those WTF cliffys,5
B00JDYC5OI,"To be honest, I didn&#8217;t know if I wanted to read Reasonable Doubt even after all the good things I&#8217;d been seeing about it. I just recently finished Sawyer Bennett&#8217;s Legal Affairs series and the blurb of Reasonable Doubt reminded me a lot of it. But I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t let that deter me from reading! Reasonable Doubt is nothing short of hot, humorous and all around amazing.Andrew and Aubrey are quickly likable. Yes, Andrew is a condescending, arrogant, son-of-a-bitch, but he wouldn&#8217;t be the man he is if he weren&#8217;t. Aubrey is sweet, funny, and a bit nave. (This seems to be a trend as of late, I think.)I cannot wait for the next part at all! From the heat the two are producing to the cliffhanger ending, there&#8217;s just so much to anticipate. I am so excited.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Holy hell this was a hot read. So ready for the next one. Loved it. The characters were amazing and it was very easy to read.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is part one of a three part series based on a high profile lawyer and his unusual sexual appetite and his rules. One Dinner, One Night, No Repeats! oh! and No LIARS! sounds reasonable right, but what happens when you start to get tired of that and the one person you do want isn't who they claim to be...AT ALL!I fell for this from the cover to the blurb to the story...granted it's only 60 pages and that seems to be the norm with authors these days. So if that bugs you...put this on your To Read List and wait for the whole series to come out and get it then. Yes this story is Hot and the Alpha Male is a bit messed up in the head, but we haven't learned why yet....eager to know Whitney Gracia Williams! So since it was a short story and I am not one to put out spoilers. Either go get it now or if you can't stand being teased til the next one put it on you To Read List...serious folks!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This booked grabbed my attention from start to finish, it kept me going, it made me laugh, it made my pant with need, it was that damn good!!!! if your looking for a book that's going to knock you over the head with full of passion full of desire, a good story line and chemistry that's to die for, then what the heck are you still reading this comment for!!! lol volume 2 i'm ready for!!!! bring it on",5
B00JDYC5OI,Sooo predictable! There is no love connection and then all of a sudden bam they in a heated and passionate affair. Geez,1
B00JDYC5OI,I'm hooked on a dang serial. I detest serials. Andrew is a MEGA ahole but he reeled me in like a moth to a flame. Not a lot of background on the couple but a nice set up on how they meet and a teaser/cliffhanger of what's to come. And now I wait for the next installment. Serials bite.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"This was my first time reading Whitney Gracia Williams and let me tell you it will not be the last!! She was fan-freaking-tastic!!! I loved her writing style. Dirty talking alpha male and sexy, sassy quick witted lead female!! What else could you ask for? Oh yeah, throw in a totally unique storyline with a killer cliffhanger and viola!!!! Left salivating for more. Waiting on pins and needles for the second installment to this series. Don't think about it. Just read.Happy reading!!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Reasonable Doubt was an amazing read! I picked it up to start at about 11:00pm one evening with the intentions of reading a couple chapters before heading to bed. Well I finished book one and was on to the second before I ever made it to be. This was one hot read I could not put down!,5
B00JDYC5OI,It started brilliantly and I was surprised I enjoyed the male POV. It was done well. Once the female point of view turned up in the book it did not take long for other story to take a massive dive south. Her thoughts became juvenile and I just could not go on. Disappointing.I gave it a shot and stopped at 40%.,1
B00JDYC5OI,"I'm an author, so I appreciate a good book blurb. You had me at &#34;My cock has an appetite&#34;.I loved that it was a quick read, I didn't love that it was a cliffhanger.Still, I'm hooked and can't wait for the next book to come out.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"So good, I saw that many people were reading this book on Goodreads, so I said to myself, &#34;Let me check this out. The cover looks good.&#34; Then, I read the description- and I was instantly hooked. I read this in two sittings- 1 at my lunch break and right before bed... the same night!Love Andrew- he's so damn cocky and I love it! Looking forward to the 2nd book! :)",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved this! You know it's only a taste of what is to come and the author leaves you slightly sated and anxious for more. Andrew was irresistible to me. I will be in line for the next one. The writing is nothing short of flawless, and the picture was painted perfectly. Bravo! Keep them coming Whitney Gracia Williams, I will read them.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I am hooked...literally! I saw this book on a site and the blub just made me say &#34;screw the sample, I'm buying this one&#34; .....now I'm sitting here panting for more....more  more MORE!! I love it...it's original and it's excitement around every corner...bring on book 2! I'm excited &#128521;Thank you so much for a great to be continued...I'll be there on launch day for sure. &#128515;",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I gave Reasonable Doubt 4.5 Stars.I've fallen in love with a man called Andrew! Reasonable Doubt is a sexy, fun novella and I really can't wait for part two. If the first line of the synopsis doesn't grab your attention then the premise of the story will. Andrew's past is hinted at in the prologue; something happened to turn him into the player he now is. He meets women on-line for one night stands; &#34;One dinner. One night. No repeats&#34; but Andrew meets many sorts of women and most distort the truth on their profiles, Andrew's number one rule is no lies. He abhors it and any woman caught up in a lie is quickly kicked to the kerb.One person Andrew would love to bed is Alyssa, a girl he struck up an unlikely friendship with. They met on a lawyer advice forum and much to Andrew's displeasure; their relationship is purely platonic although he uses every opportunity to change that status.I really liked Alyssa, from her point of view it was clear she wasn't who she claimed to be. Alyssa didn't lie out of malice, she just failed to correct Andrew's assumptions but that wasn't a problem as she held strong on not meeting him in person. They built up an on-line friendship via email and phone, Alyssa being the only woman Andrew kept in contact with for longer than one night. But when Alyssa goes for an intern interview both Andrew and Alyssa have no idea their worlds are about to collide and their relationship will no longer be virtual but reality.I loved Andrew; I didn't expect his character to be so funny. I loved the witty/filthy dialogue that came out of his mouth. He called things as he seen them and that made for some hilarious reading. I almost highlighted full pages at a time; you really need to read it for yourself to experience Andrew in full.The banter between Alyssa and Andrew was like foreplay for when they would actually meet, of course it was sooner than both of them had anticipated and no matter how annoyed Andrew was at Alyssa for her lies, he couldn't resist her.This is my first book by Whitney G. and I&#8217;m now adding all of her previous work to my tbr. I loved her writing and the characters she created. Novellas are a hit or a miss for me but Reasonable Doubt ticked all of the boxes. The story ended with a little twist thrown in at the last line and now I can't wait to get my hands on book two.Reasonable Doubt is a great, funny and sexy read. Andrew will charm the pants off you and you can't help but adore Alyssa. I look forward to the next part of their journey and suggest you 1-click this now. ~Ava*I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.*",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Perfect. A must read. Too sexy & too damn short! Grrrrr, I'm gonna hate the wait until the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a good read but I hate that series ends with cliffhangers because then you have to wait until the next one comes out. I'd rather it be more of a full, complete story and the have the story continue in the next book. That said, it kept my interest and I give it 5 stars anyway. : )",5
B00JDYC5OI,Short and hot read! Loved every minute of it. I read it in one sitting! Great start to what will surely be an amazing series.,5
B00JDYC5OI,I was surprised how much I liked this book.  I love the story line and the way it didn't drag on.  Can't wait for the rest.  Steamy and smart!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was one of the best short stories that I've read... Whitney did her thang in the book.OMG is all I can say, because I'm waiting for part 2 an part 3 to come out. It says that they will all be out in  April. I hope soon this book was great. On way over to goodreads now to let my booksisters know about this great read.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I really enjoyed this book, but I am so not a fan of short books.  I look forward to the next installment...",5
B00JDYC5OI,What a book I was hooked from the first page and floored through out it...the ending was well read it I promise you will love it!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,O.M.G loveeee it. Can't wait for book 2.  Whitney you have done it again..... I hope you don't make us wait too long for the next one.  Love all ur books,5
B00JDYC5OI,was a quick read that ends on a (spoiler alert) cliff hanger. the main character is a total jerk. screwing women for just one night and dismissing them like they are trash. i bought this book on the recommendations of several of the reviews that i read. dont understand how anyone can like this guy let alone feel sorry for him. wish these authors would quit trying to write books that are abviously knock offs of fifty shades of gray.,1
B00JDYC5OI,"WOW what a way to write a novella!!!!I'm not normally a fan of a series based on short novellas but all the great reviews and comments about how good it was made me want to see what all the fuss was about. And so glad I did, this novella was GREAT and I can't wait to read the next one.This book can easily be read in one sitting but be prepared it Is HOT and OMG Andrew Hamilton, some of the words that come out of his mouth.........I can't wait to find out his back storyThe story line is just that little bit different and I loved it from the 1st sentence.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This novella gets 5 stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue, and 1 star for the often laughable supporting storyline. There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV's but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved this book, the characters, the story, everything!! After been in a massive book funk for over a week, i honestly didn't have high expectations with this book, but i was pleasantly surprised. It drew my in from the first sentence, and before i knew it, i'd finished. It's one of those books that had me screaming noooo at the end, partly because i didn't want it to end, and partly because of the way it ends. I loved both Aubrey and Andrew, especially his cocky, arrogant, self- obsessed attitude, and can't wait for book 2.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy crap what an awesome read!  I read it straight through, loved every minute of it and the best 0.99 I ever spent.  It is only 78 pages and there is a cliffhanger but that just makes me that much more excited to continue reading the series.  If you are looking for a lengthy novel you won't find it here.  What you will find is a very arrogant, cocky, hot and filthy mouthed attorney Andrew.  I continuously laughed throughout this short story.He is NOT a relationship person, he has rules, very strict rules, one woman, one night and no repeats.  Absolutely no liars.  He has no friends, well except Alyssa whom he converses with on a daily basis.  I absolutely loved her!  These two were spectacular but once they meet in person there will be lies uncovered, consequences to pay and so much more!There is not much I can say other than this book is hot, intense, filled with lies but worth every minute and every penny!!  I would read it over and over again!  I highly recommend you check it out!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow!!!! I never one click these types of books. I hate spending money on short serials. But holy heck, am I glad I bought this! Andrew is a jerk! Alyssa pushes all his buttons! Perfection in my jaded eyes. I can't wait for the next installment!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I don't want to spoil this for anyone, but HOLY HANNA. The end leaves you wanting more. A huge cliff hanger.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I normally am not a fan of serials, but a very trusted friend told me I needed to read this. So, I dove in and my only regret is that the next isn't out!!! This book is fast paced, the characters are already very well developed, the plot is ridiculously good, and it is HOT. Seriously, when the second comes out I'm dropping everything to read it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"A friend recommended this, and I'm so glad she did. The dialogue between the characters was so great, and I was reading the texts and emails between the characters to my husband, they were that witty. No worries, the characters quickly meet and sparks fly. But this is a true accomplishment that the author can create such heat between two people simply with phone calls and emails. Great job! The only area I was perplexed by were the sex scenes. I felt they kind of came out of nowhere. I didn't feel the tension in the scene leading up to them. Other than that, this is a perfect read, and I will recommend it and buy the rest of the volumes!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"YES! What a hot male who is giving Jonathan a run for his money!!! LOL!! I absolutely love the banter between Andrew and Alyssa... The way their relationship evolved and how things transpired was AWESOME!!! I love these two together and CAN. NOT. WAIT. for the next book to release!!! I love all of Whitney's books and her blog.  If you haven't read the rest of them, you will not be disappointed!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was into this book within the first few pages.  I read the whole book in one day and couldn't put it down!  It does leave you hanging in the end!  Can't wait for book 2!!!  Hope it comes out soon!  I read this book from a suggestion from a group I'm in online and I'm so glad I trusted her suggestion!  I don't regret the purchase of this book one bit!!!  Can't wait for more!!!  I'm hooked!  If you don't have this in your collection I would suggest adding it ASAP!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Started reading and did Not stop til finished!! Very good indeed! Oh the end!! Next please!!! Now! That's wrong!! I will definitely be reading the next one. I gotta know what the hell happens now!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Short serial erotica and such a great read! I found this book through a facebook page(Can't remember the name) that had recommended it. So glad I checked it out, it was well worth it. I definitely didn't want it to be over, that cliffhanger was brutal! But was expected since its part of a serial series. Can't wait for part 2!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a fantastic read, a true game of cat and mouse. Andrew is deeply damaged and Audrey needs to grow a set and start living her life on her own terms. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a dumb frickin novella! Instead of doing 3 parts of RIDICULOUSLY short stories...gee why NOT make it a damn regular novel so we don't have to wait? Very annoying!! On another note however, can't wait to one-click the 2nd installment :)",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I was thoroughly enjoying this story.... Right up to the last line, then WTF! I really do hate waiting for the next book when things finish like THAT!That being said, this was HOT! Andrew & his dirty mouth!! More.... Please.....NOW! i had seen plenty of talk about this story in social media, i am glad I listened & took the time to give it a go, despite the WTF/cliffhanger type ending. While it was a little shorter than I had expected, there was plenty of hotness & character development crammed into the pages. it was certainly everything that they were saying on social media and then some. Looking forward to part 2.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Right off the bat I was chuckling, giggling and  experiencing butterflies in my belly. This guy's personality is so riveting, sexy, dirty and crazy!  I loved him. He was the show all by himself. Author did a beautiful job with him. I only rushed to buy book 2 only to find out there isn't one. Projected books 1-3 combos to be available this month though, so we shall see - but I have my doubts.Perfect quick (but not too quick) read!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I just finished reading this book,I loved it but I would of loved to have kept reading I hate to wait.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I wanted to give this book 5 stars but it was just too short.  Whitney Williams is a great writer and I can't wait to read the sequel. The dialogue was really funny and I loved hearing from the male/female perspective.After reading my umpteenth &#34;reimagining&#34; of 50 shades, this story line of hooking up anonymously via online chat rooms was refreshing.Lead male is a d-bag, but you still fall for him because apparently someone broke his heart before.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG !  This was my first read by this author, I loved and can't wait for book 2.  When will it be available?",4
B00JDYC5OI,Love this author's writing and especially her heroes. I don't like chopped up books even if they are a dollar an installment. I may defer reading book 2 until the last one is out.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I real had a great time in reading this book. I am looking forward for the next book, I hope it isn't too long.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG This book! Honestly I read the first sentence in the blurb and instantly added this to my TBR list. I counted the days until it was released and the moment it popped up on Amazon I one-clicked! I then proceeded to devour this story. I cannot even begin to tell you how great this was! This one is impossible to describe and hot and steamy don't even begin to cover it! I never expected the twist or the way it ended and I'll be honest I cannot wait to get my hands on more. It's not even a want, it's an absolute need. Andrew and Aubrey need to be on my Kindle now and I need to know what happens next.Andrew doesn't do commitment. He does one night only, casual sex with no repeats and he definitely doesn't do liars. He meets his women online and he doesn't have the time for anyone who isn't honest and up-front with him. He is a successful lawyer and only has one friend. He met Alyssa on a lawyer chat website for lawyers to interact with one another. She is the only person that he considers to be a friend and he has never met her in person. They talk on the phone, text and email. He has been pushing to meet in person but she always finds a way to avoid it. Until one day when he is interviewing interns for his office and comes face to face with her. Only she isn't the 27 year old ugly red head that she told him she was. She is 22, blonde and he is instantly attracted to her because she is just his type. Well his type except that clearly she is a liar and is actually named Aubrey. When she gets the position at his firm, he wants nothing more to do with her. But the connection that they shared before is nothing compared to what it is like now that they are dealing with each other in person.Andrew is completely hot! Seriously his dirty talking ways drew me right in and wow did he steam up my Kindle! He is sexy and confident and knows exactly what he wants. He is honest to a fault and isn't afraid to blurt out exactly what he is thinking. I loved how he interacted with Aubrey and I liked their friendship. They were so blunt and were able to be so real with each other despite the lies and secrets between them. I also really liked Aubrey. She was strong and sharp, and I instantly liked how she was able to take whatever Andrew gave her and dish it right back! These two had some of the hottest banter I have ever seen. I loved it and couldn't wait to see what would happen when they came face to face. Trust me it did not disappoint! These two were super hot and the chemistry was off the charts and unlike anything I have ever seen before!I seriously have no idea why I have never read anything by Whitney Gracia Williams before, but after reading this story I will definitely be reading more from her in the future! This one was amazing and I loved every second of it. The ending was completely unexpected, and left me absolutely reeling. I need the next one now. Serials are always tough for me because I am not patient at all. But this one is so worth it, and I am really glad that I took that chance. I highly recommend this story if you like a lot of hot and steamy scenes and especially if you like a dirty talker! Andrew definitely just became one of my top book boyfriends, and I can't wait to get more of him! I really hope that we aren't left waiting for the next installment for long, because I am not sure if I can handle it! This one is a must read, and I can't wait to dive back in and read it all over again!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"The way the story flows is incredible. I really enjoyed the author's writing and the way she captivated the story so fluidly. It kept me turning the pages...until the, well, I can't say the end because now I'm dying for the next one! Great, sexy read that kept you wanting to now more with every swipe of the page.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but this book drew me in and kept me reading.  I loved both of the characters and found seeing their developing relationship from both sides was great.  I highly recommend this book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was so hot!  I literally read it in one sitting and loved it!  I absolutely ca not wait for the next one!  The chemistry between Aubrey and Andrew was amazing!  Love how she doesn't take his crap!!!  Whitney Gracia Williams, excellent job, really!!!!!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew, Andrew, Andrew!  If only I had sex with the likes of Andrew...whew!  This story is unique in my opinion based on the fact that he's a lawyer and she's a law student, I haven't read one with the story line that is presented here, I don't want to give it away but it's great!  I hope that the future stories stay this way.  Please buy this book if you wan't racy, hot, steamy, sex with a great story being told.  The only thing I would change would be making her older.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Notice: Book 1 of a 3 part series!! As you can see by the blurb, Andrew only has one night stands. For some reason, he can't stand liars(we do not find out why in this book). He meets these women on an online dating site. Alyssa, he meets on a site that is supposed to be for lawyers-a social network called LawyerChat. They become friends and chat with each other for 6 months. Here it is: Andrew only lies about his name, they only know him as Thoreau. Alyssa lies about everything!! But Andrew doesn't find out about the lies until she applies for an internship at his law firm. Needless to say, Aubrey(Alyssa), shocks the bejesus out of him. And that is all I am saying. Yep, you will need to read the book to find out what happens. Oh and can we say &#34;Major cliffhanger&#34;!! WTF, Andrew has another lie??? Another winning series in my opinion, you definitely need to read. I totally loved it, can't wait for part 2. I was given a copy of this book for an honest review. Warning: Steamy sex scenes, very erotic!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I liked this a lot! It was really short so I wanted more and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I will say although I like Andrew I did find him a bit ambivolent. I would have preferred just cocky and arrogant but I'm sure there more to him.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Wow I loved this book!!Never seen it ending with such a cliff hanger.Can't wait till the next book will be out.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew and Aubrey are my new favorite characters!!  I'm not sure I can wait until the next book is released to find out what happens next.  The sexual and emotional connection between these two held me captive from the beginning, when they hadn't even met in person.  Loved it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Some bad boys you just have to love, and Andrew is one of those, you can feel how much he is hurting, and that it's the reason he acts the way he does. From the beginning you are drawn into his life, especially his correspondence with Alyssa in it you can see some of the nan that he should be and would be if not for his past, which is a mystery but you can feel it ever present in his life like a storm cloud always overhead oppressing him.Alyssa/Aubrey is the perfect foil for him, bright, intelligent, young and still believing but she made a fatal mistake in the beginning she lied, and that is unforgivable in his eyes.The writing as always with Whitney has you captivated from the start and I was so surprised when I finished as I had got so caught up in the story I hadn't noticed time passing.This is the first in the series and I cannot wait for the future instalments to find out what is in Andrew and Aubrey's future.I received a free copy for an honest review.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Love, love, love these books!  My only problem is they are tooooo short.  I keep saying I'm not going to buy anything that required waiting on the sequel.  I did anyway!  I loved it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew Hamilton doesn't do relationships. His thing...one night, no repeats...until a casual meeting on a website for lawyers has Andrew rethinking his one night only business.Aubrey is just as charming as Andrew and can dish out quick witted comebacks that have Andrew waiting more.This couple is amazingly sexy and Andrew's Armani suits and filthy mouth had me begging for more.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a super sexy novella. Steamy, funny and entertaining, it was the perfect combo.Reasonable Doubt was very much on the short side, but it was great! Thankfully, we don&#8217;t have to wait long for the next installment! Especially after that ending!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Loved this! This was a short, steamy read, that kept me very entertained and it ended with a BANG! I can't wait for the next installment!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"My thoughts&#8230;Oh man&#8230;Wow&#8230; This novella &#8211; not sure it&#8217;s actually novella since it&#8217;s 63 pages, but anyway. This novella is Part One in the Reasonable Doubt series and It. Is. HOT! Seriously. I&#8217;m not gonna lie. I was blushing. Normally I like to wait until a series is complete before reading it, but after reading the reviews I knew I had to read it immediately.Did you read the synopsis up above? No? Okay, I&#8217;ll hold on until you do. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. All right. Is that HOT or what? I immediately went to Amazon and snatched up a copy of this book. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve read a synopsis that&#8217;s as blunt as this one is. It was straightforward and spot on. It made me think that Andrew is a man that knows what he wants and is not afraid to show it. Do I consider him a player? Not really. Again he knows what he wants and that&#8217;s that. And Alyssa. I really liked her. The banter between these two is hot AND hilarious. I was literally cracking up while reading their conversations.Overall, I liked the writing, the plot, the characters, and the steamy scenes. One thing I didn&#8217;t like is the length. I would have much preferred to read a full novel or even a longer novella as a complete story instead of breaking it down to small parts.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I absolutely loved this, it was steamy and funny!!! Both characters got my attention from the start! I am officially hooked and becoming a stalker.. need book 2 now!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Okay, I just devoured this in like 90 minutes! Andrew / Thoreau is sexy and frustrating, and sexy and irritating, and did I mention sexy? Yes, it ends on a cliffhanger. But I love those, personally, and Andrew is worth every dirty-talking, frustrating minute! I'm gonna need another Andrew fix soon, though. Holy cow, I need some water to put these flames out! Wow!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I'll be honest I didn't know what to expect when I read this novella. This is the first book I've read from this author. I was surprised I loved it as much as I did. Of course the story starts with our Alpha male in a heated moment. I must say its always refreshing when a man is blunt and to the point even though he's a little cruel in the way he goes about it. I can do nothing but admire that. I have no idea what happen to Andrew Hamilton to make him the way he is. He only does one night stands and never sleeps with anyone twice. Someone must have stomped all over his heart. He also has no female friends except Aubrey. They tell each other any and everything. Though she is keeping some huge secrets. Like where she works, her age and her name. The way he finds out the secret is nothing less than shocking. Of course he was cruel to her while still being attracted to her. He was genuinely hurt when he confronted her about it. So I'm guessing whatever happened 6 years gave him zero tolerance for lying. Though if that one heated moment in her apartment (which he showed up unannounced i might add)is how he handles lying then she should lie more often (kidding). After another heated moment in his office the next day things seemed to have settled between the two that is until his wife (uh-oh)shows up at the office and messes everything up. I know there is more to the story as we still have no idea what happened 6 years ago to change him in a profound way. I'm looking forward to read where Aubrey and Andrew go from here and what exactly happened to him all those years ago.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"It sounded good at first, but as soon as her lies were uncovered, the character became silly and immature. The way this ends abruptly doesn't make me want to know what happens next ...",1
B00JDYC5OI,"READ THIS!!The setup for this story line is amazing. Aubrey a pre-law student steals her mother's info to become a member of LawerChat an online discussion board for lawyers seeking advice on cases or simply support within their community. Here she hopes to get help on her assignments so she can spend more time developing her ballet career, her real dream, while making her parents happy by pursuing a paying career. This is how she meets ""Thoreau"" the only lawyer on the site that will answer her simple questions. Everything is strictly professional. However, their relationship turns into something else after he requests her phone number because her brief has so many mistakes he doesn't want to type them all out.Soon they develop a friendship albeit a very naughty one filed with late night phone calls...Oh this is a delight! And the best part of all is that Whitney Garcia Williams has used a unique format in which to write her short stories, they are like episodes. The cliffhanger at the end is to die for and I cannot wait for the next installment.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Five stars but I'm waiting on the next installment of &#34;Reasonable Doubt.&#34; I'm glad I lucked up and found your book Whitney. I had it on my IPad for about three weeks I didn't want to read it because I hate reading books where you have wait for next installment. But last night I didn't have anything else to read so I decided to open up your book and I must say I was surprise how great the story was. It kind of reminded me of me and my best friend; how we met online then it took three years before we meet each other, we're still best friend to this day. Well back to your story, it was absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to read the next one. Thanks for a great story Whitney.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a fun quick and hot read. Andrew dripped of sex and sarcasm, which are 2 things I love and Alyssa (Aubrey) was sweet and sexy and had a backbone, great qualities in a female character... OOO and there was even a plot... So hot characters, hot sex, sarcasm and quick wit, and a plot equals 5 stars to me!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was outstanding! I can't wait for the next installment! For such a short read, the connection to the characters and the progression of the story was incredibly natural and didn't seem rushed at all, unlike most. This is the first book I've read by this author and I will definitely be reading more of her work. The story is well-written and absolutely hilarious. The author was able to create an angsty, steamy, sexy story that was entertaining and believable, in a way that most full-length novels are not. It ends with a huge cliffhanger, so I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment in this series. I'm an addict for sure.All I can say is read it. You won't be sorry!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I absolutely cannot believe that I let this book sit in my Kindle for a while and didn't even give it a glance. My loss! This shorty was incredible. And since I'm here in North Carolina, it was nice to get a taste of home in this story. This series is going to  be hot and I'll wait eagerly for the next one! Great Whitney! &#34;It is what it is.&#34; Well, baby, it's damn good! Bring it on.",5
B00JDYC5OI,The book drew me right in. I was very disappointed at the length this book. It was only 0.99 but still I expected at least a 4 hour read. This only took me an hour. I enjoyed the story line it stopped very abruptly.,3
B00JDYC5OI,Loved this book!  Fell in love  with the characters from the start.  Looking forward to the next installment.Whitney's writing style is awesome.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow hotness!!!! Mr. Hamilton is hot I cannot wait to read more about him and see what happens next!! Hope the next one comes out soon,!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,There aren't enough words to say home much I loved this book. I'm a huge fan of Whitney Gracia Williams and I'll read anything she puts out. She did not disappoint with this one. I can't wait for the next installment.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Ok seriously I have to wait for book two? I hate it when I'm left hanging but I'm looking forward to the next book I hope it does t take too long I like the h/H they had an interesting relationship I'm looking forward to see what happens next,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book should come with a WARNING label: Hot content inside. Reading will cause instant blushing especially if read in public. A nearby available cold drink is suggested before starting this book as well as at least an uninterrupted hour of your time to finish it.Meet Andrew AKA Thoreau. &#8220;The one dinner. One night. No repeats,&#8221; no friend, sexy as sin man you might meet if you checkout Date-Match. You might also meet &#8220;Thoreau&#8221; through his other online account at LawyerChat, but only if you&#8217;re a lawyer or are pre-law student pretending to be one, like &#8220;Alyssa.&#8221;They meet online talking about work but develop a sort of friendship that leads to them talking and texting. And after six months Adrew wants to meet her and have her, while she is completely reluctant knowing he has zero tolerance for liars and she&#8217;s been lying all along.What happens when chance and coincidence conspire against them is an explosion of confusion, anger and desire. And then we find out that Alyssa is not the only one that lied.And now we wait&#8230; Even though I prefer to read series or serials in this case after all the books have come out, this book it really worth the delay. It&#8217;s certainly steamy, full of dry humor and crass conversations that I loved, with a depth to Alyssa&#8217;s character and a hit of it in Adrew&#8217;s case that make for a very interesting plot. Can&#8217;t wait for the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved this book.  I like hearing both points of view from the characters.  I have to read more.  I will be recommending to my friends and to anyone who enjoys reading at all.  Definitely keeps you thinking, wishing and hoping.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"So I didn't realize this book was a short story. That being said it left me hanging like no other. I have no idea when the second one is coming out, but let me tell you it's definitely not soon enough. This story pulls you in. The male lead is hilarious. The book is definitely juicy and intertesting. It left me wanting more and I can't wait til I can put my hands on Volume 2. Good read for sure.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This ""book"" would have been fantastic if it didn't end right as it was getting started. Seriously, way too short. Just combine the books instead if doing 3+  volumes, it's just annoying. I felt like I just read a sample!",2
B00JDYC5OI,OMG I can't wait for the next part of this serial!!! I loved the idea of this story. The banter between Andrew and &#34;Alyssa&#34; over the phone and in their emails was hysterical and very naughty too!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Whit, you naughty girl you! I have read each and every one of your romance stories, and lets just say that you have learned a thing or two along the way, lol! This one grabbed me right from the start, and literally had me screaming at the end. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it was all going to be revealed, and then out of thin air, you threw in a zinger! Wow, just Wow! I don't want to talk about the plot, as each reader needs the unexpected thrill of experiencing the story as it unfolds, so just read it already!Whitney, I'm so proud of you and your work: and I have personally experienced how you have grown and evolved since the Jilted Bride Series (1st edition), to the brilliant Mid Life Love saga, and now this amazing start to the Reasonable Doubt serial, and lets not forget My Last Resolution: Quite simply, You Rock!!! I am impatiently waiting with bated breath for the next edition, so please keep them coming!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"no plot...ridiculous trash talk...just bad, bad, bad.  I also hate these serial novellas...they are almost always terrible and this one is not exception.",1
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG! What a trip!  Settle in as we meet Andrew. He's cocky, arrogant, and a successful partner in a big law firm.  He loves sex. He peruses the dating sites for one-night hook-ups with well-endowed blondes. That's his MO. One Night. No Relationship.  What he hates, with a passion, is liars!  Why is everybody lying about themselves? I am dying to find out what happened in his past that makes him absolutely despise liars?! Then we meet Alyssa on a lawyer chat site of which he uses a different name. Why isn't that lying I wonder? They become fast friends conversing about cases, briefs, and sentences. I can't give you much more because there are so many twists in this short story I was gasping with hands on my face, and grinning from ear to ear, throughout this book! I loved it! Let's just say this self-proclaimed honest, truth speaking person is not all that! The ending made me speechless!  Gosh don't make me wait long for book 2!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Oooh... This is good!! I'm loving Andrew and Aubrey and cannot wait to see what happens next. This one ends on an OMG moment, where you're left hanging with your mouth wide open. But I'm already pulling for these two and I'm betting the ""visitor"" is going to cause problems. Can't wait for Number 2.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I squeezed Reasonable Doubt into my reading schedule because I've heard so many good things about his story.  Holy chit!  This story is freaking hot!  Lawyer Andrew &#34;Thoreau&#34; Hamilton is the epitome of that smug, oh-so-beautiful, arrogant jerk-off.  I mean the first line in the synopsis tells you exactly the kind of man he is, &#34;My cock has an appetite.&#34;  And because I'm a shameless floozy, this one sentence instantly had me wanting to read this story.Andrew is a &#34;love them and leave them' kind of guy.  Battling demons from his past (aren't they always?), he is a serial one night stand type of dater.  He has yet to meet a woman who will change his ways.  After hitting a dry spell in his man-whoring activities, Andrew meets newbie lawyer &#34;Alyssa&#34;/Aubrey on a lawyer networking site.  Aubrey is seemingly immune to Andrew's charms and they form an anonymous friendship in the process.  Unfortunately, Andrew has a huge problem with liars and &#34;Alyssa&#34;/Aubrey has committed this sin against him.  The ensuing angst that unfolds between them is why I love romance reads!I was surprised how well the author was able to give depth to the characters in such a short story.  I really connected with Andrew and Aubrey.  Their chemistry together is off the charts HOT!  And the sex scenes are a freaking inferno.  I chuckled to myself when I read her acknowledgement and she said she wanted to write &#34;fade to black&#34; for the sex scenes.  She did a fantastic job of writing them.  She should not be embarrassed by it at all!Do yourself a favor and buy Reasonable Doubt.  It's a so well-written and sexy as hell.  It's a short read so you can get yourself all worked up during your lunch hour.  This is a serial series, so you are left with a bit of a cliffhanger.  But it didn't upset me in the least.  It just makes me want the next book even more!Written by Dee McGee - Booze, Bookz, and Bad Boyz",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Omg did that just end like that. I'm in total shock right now. Oh Andrew you have a lot of explaining to do mister. He's been so hard on Aubrey for lying about her identity and he's been lying to her all along too. Man I'm dying right now for the next book. Good for Aubrey for throwing his coffee on him. Lol! You know I try really hard to not like Andrew because he's an ass, jerk, man whore, and total prick to Aubrey while she's working for him. But you can't help but love him either. And holy hottness can he talk dirty and do even dirtier things.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I think this is a good start to this series.  I liked it very much.  We like these characters right away.  Can't wait to hear the next episode.  Alyssa is smart, confident and interesting.  Andrew is hot alpha all the way!  The author wrote a thoughtful, fun, wonderful tale of unexpected love and desire.  Very good !  Enjoy !!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"After reading the blurb I wasn't sure what to think. I am so glad I decided to buy this book. The story and characters grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I always enjoy an alpha, bad boy and Andrew fits this perfectly. I am hooked and cannot wait for the next installment! Please release it asap!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"That's how you left me? With a cliffhanger??? Good book!! I want more ASAP!! Please! I'm on bended knees. Can't wait for book 2. Lawd have mercy! Hell, even I want to scream Andrew!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Love, love ,loved this book, when is #2 out, I can hardly wait.  Andrew, love him he's the type of character I love in these types of books, a little messed up from something in his past but has finally met someone he will go (I hope) to great lengths to have forever and I cannot wait to see their journey. A must read because I can tell this is going to be one great series. Please hurry with next book and Andrew is HOT, HOT, HOT!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! I love, love, love this story. It took me completely by surprise and I cannot wait to read the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I really enjoyed this story. The characters are well balanced. The unforgiving Boss......can't wait for the next installment. The story was good so far.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was shocked how much I enjoyed this short story, and now I cannot even recall how I came across it -- probably via Pinterest.While it's an easy comparison on its face Reasonable Doubt really seems like the natural follow-up to Beautiful Bastard, of course for the obvious reasons of more-seasoned male professional and less-seasoned female and the obvious carnal attraction which exists. However, I also found this author's writing to be as clean, as spare, as lyrical as that of the authors who wrote the Beautiful series. I greatly enjoyed how descriptive it was without being flowery.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Funny. Angsty. Sexy. Hot. Enjoyable. I can't wait for the next installment.Read it and I promise you won't be disappointed.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew can I just say totally yummy. This book was hot, sexy from the very beginning. If your looking for an deep, dark, blunt man. Andrew Hamilton is that man. I feel in love with the story from the beginning. I just couldn't put it down. Can't wait for for book 2.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Can not wait for the next installment. Ending on the scene it did was pure torture. Things are gonna get messy!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This short serial novella is a well written, sassy piece of erotica.  Loved it and can't wait for the next.  I was grabbed from the first page and didn't stop until I was done.  Auto buy for this author.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew,Andrew,Andrew where do I begin....A hot take no nonsense attorney, a real sleep with them and leave them kinda jerk rough around the edges with secrets of us own with a secret past has finally come across a women who he breaks his rules for...Alyssa,...or Aubrey lol is a sexy witty girl striving to fulfill her dreams while following  through on a life her parents expect of her she crosses paths with this sexy Andrew and gets under his skin ...I don't want to say anymore bc I don't want to spoil it but just know this book was a book you just can't put down (we all have a few of those) and just like all your other favorites this one does not disappoint!! I can t wait for book two I highly recommend!!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Whoa!!! This book was pretty dark and intense. Andrew totally has issues and I can't wait to read about them!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is the first serial I've ever read and I'm now obsessed...with Andrew's c*ck, that is.Oh, and the storyline!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I am at a complete loss for words! Holy hell! I think I just experienced the hardest bookgasm I've EVER had. If I were a man, I'd be a raging mess right now...this has got to be the most painful yet satisfying tease I've ever experienced. Beyond the flawlessly written words, there is a dynamic story. This a MUST-READ!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Ok! I read the blurb and thought it sounded like a good read. I was looking for something to just be different... Little did I know that my book page did the book tour. (Cough cough) I was sick that day. ;) No seriously.. I was. Anyway.. I really enjoyed this story.. So far. I didn't know it was a serial right away. I must have looked at the page #'s at some point because I figured it out and yelled at myself! lol I don't mind reading serials.. I just like it best when their all out and I can read them back to back. I'm not a super fast reader or anything, but I am impatient when it comes to a good book and this so far has a good story. What can I say, Mr. Hamilton....... Tsk tsk. Andrew Hamilton is hot! I'm going now.. Can't give away the story because well.... It would ruin it. I now need to leave this review and go hunt down the author and see if she has a Facebook page so I can stalk her next release and maybe try and hypnotize her into finishing up the rest of this 3 part serial storyline... Or maybe she needs me to read what she has written so far.... :D I need to know the rest like today. LOL I'm not really going to stalk her... :)Ok the norm... Yes I would say read this, yes it was good. Yes the chemistry of the two mains of this story have off the chart chemistry.. Sizzling comes to mind.. Andrew freaking Hamilton.... Whew!5 stars",5
B00JDYC5OI,I really wish this was a longer story..unfortunately is not and had left me hanging... I really really like it.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Once more the reader is presented with a trilogy. Once more the reader is presented with a young, hot, rich, sexually insatiable H who presents himself of somewhat a dom. Of course the H is arrogant and narcissitic, but hides &#34;deep pain.&#34;  Boo hoo. This story is getting old, unoriginal and quite frankly boring. Let us not forget the h. She is presented as young, pretty, book smart, but unwise of the ways of a hole men. These poor women just cannot help themselves around such men. Why their panties simply melt off their bodies. They love these men and want to heal their hurts. Have I covered it?  Please don' t get me started on the whole sex in the workplace. Sick! Are we back to the stone age again.This book is a trilogy. Let me save the reader. Part One ends where the h discovers the H is married. Does it sound like I will be reading part 2? Returned for refund.",2
B00JDYC5OI,"First off, this book was off the charts hot! I'm sitting here trying to figure out when book 2 will be out! This was a novella about an attorney that doesn't get involved with any females emotionally. One dinner, one night and no repeats is all that he wants until he talks to Aubrey. Aubrey is a law student/ballet dancer that just applied to his law firm as an intern. Secrets and lies all come out with a lot of hot sex and a dirty mouth!",4
B00JDYC5OI,OH! M! WORD! This book is freaking awesome! I did not expect that ending! Andrew Hamilton is the guy you love to hate but can't!!!! I loved Aubrey and Andrews back and forthness...yep my own wording... It just builds and builds TIL BAM! I'm done cause ill spill the beans! But I'm really looking forward to the next book! I loved this book a lot!!!! So much so I gifted it to others!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"And then came Whitney G. A woman that forced me to buy this short story with interesting and titillating teasers that filled up my instagram feed. And then I sat down and read it. And I'm always to interested in relationships that start over a chat/forum/internet connection. I'm even more intrigued when one of the parties finds out they were 'lied' too. Well, Andrew needs to get the eff over his dang issues because Alyssa is the best thing that could possibly happen to him.She's smart, wealthy, and needs a way out of her crap family! She's also a dancer. A heart felt soulful dancer.What Andrew our hard headed alpha male doesn't realize is that he is already done for. Not only did this cliffhanger of a book spoil all his fun! But it gave Alyssa leverage of her own.Do you see what I did here? I totally made you want to read this, and then you will, and then you will totally whine about the cliffhanger.I say...GET OVER IT!The story is good!The end...",5
B00JDYC5OI,I really enjoyed this first book. It was a fast and fun read. Loved how they met and the storyline. Really good writing and I really enjoyed it!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I give this book five stars. It was entertaining, hot as he'll and I loved Aubrey and Andrew. I can not wait I need to read book two.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This short story definitely was worth reading! This is the first book I've read from Whitney Gracia Williams and let me tell you I am a fan already from just reading this short story. You will not regret it; it's so captivating and intense, before I knew it I had already finished the book. Great storyline & Andrew is simply sex on a stick! Can not wait for the second book to this. Will be waiting patiently for Mr. Hamilton ;)",5
B00JDYC5OI,I am at a loss on this one. This book blew me away. The chemistry is amazing. The plot is the best and the ending left me with a what the hell. Can not wait for the next book.,5
B00JDYC5OI,It's a must read. I have a thing for lawyers so  Andrew  made it better. Hot hot sex scenes &#128293;,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew Hamilton is the new Dom in town.  He is not your usual caveman... let's just say he is a sophisticated one.  After all, he is a lawyer at the top of his game.This man wrote the book on the love 'm leave 'm scenario.  Mostly never twice with the same woman; if more than once not for long.  You know he has secrets and they are buried in his past.  He is straight forward and honest to the point that rude is a word that should apply but does not.For a man with no friends or relationships he is wound tight with no place to de-stress other than these meaningless hook-ups.  One exception... the virtual &#34;friendship&#34; he shares while trolling a lawyers only website.  He strikes a mentoring friendship with Alyssa and this goes on for months.  Now that he has hit a dry patch in his hook-ups, he is intrigued and wants to meet her.Take the plunge and join the party as we follow Whitney Garcia Williams' masterpiece in this journey of mystery, sex, passion, and most of all secrets.  Who knows where it might lead us, but it sure fun so far!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Consider this it was 78 pages!  Author knew just when to break it off so you need to buy the second in the series.Alexander Hamilton is an attorney in a prestiges law firm.  What he does in his own time is that he hooks up with woman for one night stands.  After a number of years he has it pretty much down pat - One dinner, One night.  He joins this other .com hookup to meet other professionals like he.  This website you don't meet them on the outside - you aren't even allowed to get their phone number.  However, he does get her number & begins a six month telephone relationship with &#34;Alyssa&#34;.  He thinks she's is nearer to his age - which she never discounts.  He likes her voice and she asks him questions related to work (he thinks her office - she's not but is in pre-law & a junior @ Duke).  He finally gets her number and they text and phone each other everyday. He wants to meet her but she refuses. She's up for an summer internship and the night before her interview at the law firm she asks him a question thats on the application.  He tells her what he would say - and follows up with &#34;it is what it is&#34;.  Guess where she's going for the interview?  Oh I failed to mention she doesn't know Hamilton is &#34;Thoreau&#34; the name he gave her. Her real name is Aubrey Everhart. When the interview heads to the questionnaire part, the same question she put to him the night before is asked he believes its a coincidence, until he sends her a text on her phone.  She never turns her phone off, the jig is up.  Hamilton is way beyond pissed cause he hates liars, and what she has done has wasted his time.  He makes it so she interns for him and he belittles her every chance he has.  When she has to slip off to a ballet class he refuses her request to leave early.  He finally demotes her to assistant to his secretary.  I wanted to see where this went but we got a cliffhanger of an ending when his ex-wife arrives at his office.  Will this want you to buy the second book in the series?  Hopefully the 2nd book is more than 78 pages",3
B00JDYC5OI,More than a little surprised about the start of this story.  Aubrey is creative in how she acquires help on her coursework.  Andrew appears to be running from something in his past that he can't escape from no matter where he moves.  Good story.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a good read .but waiting months for the ending ,or another cliff hanger then sometimes  it goes into a third book.  I try to stay away from until the are all there to read .Real good writer though.Hope  to read the next in series.grrrrrr lol",4
B00JDYC5OI,The main character is a douchebag. The female character is hot and quick witted. I loved them both and I am anxiously awaiting the next book.,5
B00JDYC5OI,This book is hot B-E-Y-O-N-D hot!! I couldn't put it down. Normally I don't like when a character talked the way Andrew did..but hot DAYUM he could talk dirty to me ANYTIME!!! Part...2....soon...PLEASE,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book is Ah-Mazing!!! I couldn't put this book down and I NEED book two now!Aubrey is struggling with doing what she wants and what her parents want.  She decides to join a lawyer group to get help with pre-law work. She knows it's wrong and she never expected to find a friend.  She never wanted to deceive Thoreau, even though she knew it wasn't his real name.  She never thought she would ever meet him.  What happens when they meet? Can she make him listen?Andrew or Thoreau as he goes by to his online flings, is happy with his life.  He meets woman online and chats with them for a week then screws them and is done and moves on to the next.  He has a unknown connection to Alyssa, who he meets on a lawyer site.  He tells her repeatedly that he hates liars. Though she still deceives him.  Can he forgive her? Or does he walk away? But what happens when he can't stay away?This is an amazing first installment to this serial.  I cannot wait to see what happens with Aubrey and Andrew.  This is going to be a long couple weeks till the next book is out!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"The cover had my right hand hovering and the synopsis led my one-click finger to finish the deal.What can I say, I love a filthy talker draped in confidence and a well-tailored suit.Andrew Hamilton radiates sexual heat and has no time for liars or women who want more from him than just one night of mind-blowing sex.A character like Alyssa quickly becomes one of my favorite heroines. She's beautiful, smart, knows what she wants out of life and becomes the obsession of a no-nonsense, arrogant attorney who is driven just short of crazy by being pushed into the friend zone by the calm distance she keeps between them. I loved the duel POV and this author masters the male inner voice. Even though this is only a short novella, it sure doesn't read like one. Whitney G. was able to craft a sexy-hot well-written story with all the elements of a full length one.  I will be waiting patiently for the next release. Highly recommend",5
B00JDYC5OI,"So I took a break from studying, and started browsing Goodreads for a bit, and came upon this book. I read the first few lines of the blurb- got up to ""One dinner. One night. No repeats"" - before I just stopped and bought it. That's how you sell a book!I needed a quick distraction and this one was perfect! What a book! It was short and sexy, and the plot was fun, but boy am I frustrated. This ends with a cliffhanger, and I'm gagging for the next installment! Buy this if you want a quick read that's filled with spiciness. The chemistry between these two characters was hot hot hot!! Loved it!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"So I thought I'd slowly start reading and savour the book. What ended up happening was me devouring the entire thing and forsaking everything around me! The characters of Andrew and Aubrey are brilliant. Both are complicated and secretive individuals. Aubrey is sweet and yet feisty. Andrew is at times cold but he does have compassion when he devotes his time to helping Aubrey. And he is really smoking hot! The two of them have hidden parts of their lives but Andrew is clear about his relationships; lie and it's over. Their phone and email conversations are humorous, endearing and, at times, very hot. Whitney Gracia Williams does a fantastic job in sucking you into the story and before you know it, POW! You are sucker-punched with a cliffhanger! A revelation you don't expect but, fortunately for us, the second book is available to ease the blow. I can't wait to read more. If you haven't read it, go. Go now!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Funny, entertaining page turner. I immediately went to buy the next in the series and it wasn't there! Bummer! C'mon Mrs Williams! Finish this story. BTW, the male POV in this book is a real hoot. I laughed out loud many times. Mrs Williams is on my one click list now.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG!!! The writing was superb. Held u from beginning to end. It's funny, sexy and oh so bad. I loved it.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"4 to 4.5 starsEnjoyable read. I enjoyed the premise. Enjoyed the moments of him realizing what was happening. Would have liked just a bit more insight into Andrew. I'm sure that's coming in the next installment but I wanted it here. I'm really looking forward to the next book. I'm not sure these characters will leave enough of an impact to stay with me months from now, but I definitely want to read the next book if it releases soon.",4
B00JDYC5OI,This story pulled me in from the first few paragraphs. I wanted to see what he was up to and find out more about her. I can't wait for the next installment to find out what happens.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"**** EROTICA BOOK CLUB REVIEW ****Reasonable Doubt: Volume 1 (Reasonable Doubt #1)by Whitney Gracia WilliamsAndrew loves sex but never sleeps with the same woman twice so he hunts dating sites finding women for dinner sex and never see them again. He also has a thing about women lying even though he hides his true identity from them.He becomes friends with a woman online via a lawyer site and as she keeps asking his help with cases they become close and chat to each other on the phone on a regular basis. It in inevitable that there paths will eventually cross...This is a short story and I try to not review books under 100 pages that are not free.  I actually won a copy in a giveaway and OMG I am so glad that I did, this book is a real gem and I am quite sad that I might never had the pleasure of reading this. I can honestly say I would have paid the 77p (0.99 US) gladly.I love Andrew and I really do love my men in books to be like him arrogant and a dirty talker and well there is a whole lot of him to love if you get my drift...  He had me drooling from the very begining. I also liked &#34;Alyssa&#34; she is really cool character and I love her personality.This is defiantly a a hot and sexy read and it starts right from the first page, it well written and I will defiantly be reading books by this author again.OH but there is a cliffy ending.... I still love this book and will go straight onto book 2!5 stars for Amazon & 5 stars for Goodreads~Jane~",5
B00JDYC5OI,"sulking here. I knew this was part 1 of a story, I downloaded it anyway, with the intention of reading it when all parts were released. Clearly I failed, and read it.This was a super read in all ways...build up, intrigue, hot bods and sexy sexy sexy, did I say SEXY bits?And the ending, groan, that's why I'm sulking, cos I now have to wait for part 2READ this, highly recommended",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually enjoyed a self-published erotica novel. This is new for me as generally speaking the novels are sex first, plot nonexistent, dialogue laughable and grammar/writing-style amateur, but REASONABLE DOUBT was a decent, if short read.Andrew Hamilton, known to his chat room hookups as Thoreau, has relocated from New York to North Carolina thanks to some awful, abstract thing. We're lead to believe it is a lying woman, but can't be sure. We can be sure that Andrew hates liars and is only interested in casual sex. The latter says as much on his profile and Andrew says as much to his hookups. Through another chat room for lawyers only, he is introduced to Alyssa, a 27-year-old attorney that welcomes his legal advice, but spurns his sexual overtures. They become fast friends -- each other's only friend -- over a sixth month period. During this time, Andrew pushes for them to meet in person while Alyssa refuses. When they finally meet, under the worst possible circumstances, the book takes an even more interesting turn.The story flowed well and the characters -- while romance novel go-to archetypes -- were interesting, their actions believable. I will agree with other readers that the story was short, but not to it's detriment. Would it be better if the author just combined the serial into one full length novel? For speed readers like me, yes. For the good of the story, no. The cliffhanger at the end would not pack the same punch in a full length format. Understanding the characters' motivations: Andrew's abject hatred of liars and Alyssa's reasons for refusing to meet ultimately make the abrupt ending all the better. I'm interested to see where the story goes and recommend to anyone on the fence like I was. It was a breezy and entertaining read. 4.5 stars.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Dear Mr. Hamilton, I think you are a scared little commitment phobic man-whore and you may have met your match with Aubrey!Here's a series to watch.  Sexy man-whore attorney has unwittingly fallen for an intern he first thinks is an attorney without a life.They talk on the phone often and text or rather sext!If accidentally meets her in person and it's off to the races for a seemingly doomed romance, but scorching hot romance that may or may not go anywhere.It deserves more than 5/5 stars, and it deserves more than 5/5 flames for HOTNESS!BUY IT but be prepared for additional installments.I Loved IT y'all!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Who starts a synopsis for their book with, &#34;My cock has an appetite.&#34; and gives that quoted lead male character an online dating site alias of Thoreau? Well, that's what Whitney Gracia Williams has done, and that's just a tiny preview of how unique her characters and her story are. The story of Andrew and Aubrey is difficult to describe without spoilers, so instead I will state that I really loved everything about this book. The writing is superb; the characters are relatable and well-defined, and the plot certainly held my interest. I easily read it straight through because I could not put it down! Warning, there is a bit of a cliffhanger. For me, that just makes it more exciting to wait for the next part of the story and should not be a deterrent to reading this fantastic book! I need more Andrew and Aubrey soon because the next book promises to get even hotter and more twisted!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Yes it says this book is volume 1 in this series but just when the story was getting interesting it ends just short of a revelation.  Though short and to the point I like that the author didn't drag these characters and git to the point of showing us how they are. There's still some unanswered questions I have about  the characters and will be reading more of them in the next installments.,3
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy s***! I need the next book right now! Usually a story this short doesn't appeal to me, but with all of the 5 star reviews I had to give it a shot...so glad I did! Devoured it! This was my first Whitney Gracia WIlliams book and it definitely won't be my last!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I need part 2 asap!Aside from me being pissed at the release schedule & the author delaying part 2 (for this reason I try to stay away from serial novellas), I loved this section. I'm not sure if it's fair to review just one part, because it is only a section of the book. BUT, I will and it's great. It is a pretty unique story, kind of like you've got mail, but dirty, haha. Andrew is a total jerk, but it cracks me up and I love it, and I think thats a testament to the author, for making such an a-hole likable. The relationship and banter b/t Andrew and Alyssa is hilarious and and they have major chemistry. Super hot.there is a cliffhanger ending, which is annoying, but that's to be expected w/ these serialsside note: I don't really get how Aubrey is 22 and just starting her junior year of college, most people graduate college at 21-22. And it is unlikely that she's been held back or is late in credits b/c her parents are crazy about education and would make sure she was on track.[if i were the author, however, I probably would've made all of part one purely phone/internet relationship and ended it w/ her intern interview w/ him finding out about her. This way would allow for more development of the stories/characters and would allow for more of the creative writing that we get glimpses of plus I just wish there was more of the phone/email banter. It would've still been super enjoyable and sexy, and I think readers would be dying for part 2 even more than they are now. Anyway, just my opinion.]",5
B00JDYC5OI,AAAACCKKKKKK!!!! I KNEW there was a cliffhanger and I was STILL floored when I read the last line!! You got me! Good one WGW... going to join the mailing list now so that I will know when book 2 is ready!In all seriousness this was my first read by this author and I am hooked! Quick witted and scorching hot and the flow was great!  The chemistry between Audrey and Andrew was a living breathing thing on my Kindle... WOW!,5
B00JDYC5OI,absolutly loved this book. it kept me on edge. cant wait for the second part......why is it taking so long?????,5
B00JDYC5OI,"The girls over at Two Crazy Girls With A Passion For Books recommended this book to me,letting me know it was a quick read, but very good!Boy, they weren't kidding!!!This story may be a novella, but WOW&#8230;it is packed full of all kinds of delicious yumminess!I seriously could not read it fast enough!Loved getting POV's from both characters, and the fun banter in this book is sexy as all get out!I highly recommend this book, and am excited to get my hands on Reasonable Doubt Two soon!Looks like I'll be adding Whitney Gracia Williams to my favorite Author list!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was short but oh did it grab my attention and kick up the heat.  The story was original and I wasimmediately drawn in.  At first when I read the synopsis the guy talking about his cocks appetite put me off, I figured cocky guy perspective that might annoy me.  However, that wasn't the case.  Does Andrew talk dirty a lot?  Heck yeah but it didn't grate on my nerves and his commanding presence was intoxicating.I was immediately engrossed in the story and I wanted to get to the bottom of his past and what Alyssa was hiding.  The story is well written and so captivating with wonderful twists and turns.  You are constantly thrown back and forth between these two by dialogue and actions that you just can't put the book down and you can't wait to find what happens next.The ending has me itching for the next installment in this series because holy hell!  How the tables are turned on Andrew and I so want to find out what he has to say now.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was addicted to this fast paced HOT book. It flew by I loved Andrews blatant honesty. But that cliff hanger....oh my gosh...left me dying for the next book.  I never saw it coming!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was awesome... my only complaint, way too short! I really need to read the next one to see what happens.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I'm glad I stumbled on Whitney G. This book was fun and the writing was really great...not a single typo that I could find. The characters were well developed. Yes, it's a short read, but it's fun and the page count was clear from the beginning.  I'll read the next one as long as it's priced at 99 cents.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I LOVE Andrew. This is the kind of man that I love to see &#34;fall&#34;. I love the surprise and wonder of when it's going to happen. Andrew is exactly as he is described in the Synopsis. His brain really has no control over his desire. He's a one woman a day kind of guy and the days never repeat. He's honest about it right up front so there should be no surprises. It's right there on his profile! Aubrey may have misrepresented herself a bit, but she's not looking for a man or a hook up. She's also not on a dating site. She's on an attorney site in search of legal assistance and knowledge. She never intends on meeting Andrew, so the sexual banter is harmless, right? Along comes the internship. There's no &#34;tingling electricity&#34; when they touch or any romanticized love story. There is intensity, bluntness and pure physical attraction. I was surprised and disappointed that this was a novella as I did not want this to end. This was a very quick HOT read that I ate up! The language and flow are very fast paced and there is a good amount of conversation, text and email messages. I really like knowing what is being said - especially the things that come out of Andrew's mouth. I suggest you read this. I will probably re-read this one a few times before we can get our hands on the 2nd installment. There's no HUGE cliff, but obviously more story to be told.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Whitney G. you had me at the freakin synopsis!!! Holy heck, this novella was HOT!!! Andrew&#8230; you are one steamy, panty-melting man!!! I swear I was fanning myself and was left wanting MORE MORE MORE!!! You sure as heck crammed a lot in this short novella, and I am sitting here impatiently waiting for the next installment. Between the texts, the phone conversations&#8230; and everything else (not giving anything away!), I think I hyperventilated!!!Andrew, you and your deep and piercing blue eyes and your short, dark brown hair that I'd love to tug on!!! That mouth and your words&#8230; holy GOD!!!&#34;I can't just talk to you anymore. I need to feel you, I need to taste you. Say yes&#8230;.&#34;OMG!!! And that's just a sample of him&#8230; I can't say anymore. I know this review is short, but GO GRAB IT and meet him for yourself!!!! You got a ton of OMG's from me Whitney and I'm shouting your name to everyone I know that Reasonable Doubt is a must read!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I'm so hooked to this book it's ridiculous!READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!he's super intense and my goodness almost perfect!I wanted to punch his face at the end of this book too!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I saw on Goodreads.com that several people that I was friends with had read this novella (that's what I'm going to call it).  I thought, &#34;We will try it out...see if it's good&#34;.  When I got to the cliffhanger I was so sad that it was over!  I saw that the second book was supposed to come out like the week before.  Amazon had no listing of such a book.  I went to facebook and looked around only to find out that the book had exceeded the authors expectations.  She hadn't expected anyone to like it so didn't have book two completed to follow up.  It's coming out the end of the week and I couldn't be more ecstatic!  This is definitely a great read!  You will love it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is such a short ""episode"" in a series but it completely pulled me in and now I can't wait for more. The web of deceit and mystery created by this author was brilliant. The inner monologue of the characters combined with the smart, sexy dialogue between them makes for one seriously hot, very intriguing, really well written story. I can't wait for the next chapter.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Now I swore I would never pick up another serial unless 1) I finished the other 2 addictive serials that I'm currently gagging for and 2) the series is complete and I can purchase and read everything at once. Well, none of that is happening in this case cos now I gotta wait for the next darn book to come out cos I just gotta know what happens!This was a VERY short but HOT read. The story was simple and the plot was basic (so far) but omg the sexual tension and steam was HOT! There were a few eye-roll moments reading Aubrey/Alyssa's POV near the beginning but once the story got rolling, it was full steam ahead! I didn't rate this book a 5 because as awesome as it was, compared to the other serials I'm currently reading, this one isn't as compelling or edge of seat however, still a clever, light read. It's definitely a HOT and quick read for anyone who loves a sexy office romance and doesn't scream like Veruca Salt (me) after reading a WTF cliffhanger, sudden-ending. Bring on the next instalment dammit!!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,I don't normally buy these short books. But I saw this one and it was being pimped on fb so I thought I'd try it out. Glad I did. It was sexy and funny. &#34;Check my floor for super glue&#34; loved that. Loved the way it was played out. The online & phone conversations that lead to their unplanned meeting. Can't wait for more!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I am so happy that I took the time and the few cents it cost to read this book! It was sexy and goodness, I need to find me a lawyer! Haha I suggest this book to anyone who has a sexy imagination!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Hate these short cliff hanger books. It's sooooooo HARD to keep track of the additional books. If you are like me hold off on this book until the additional books are released. It's good, worth a read.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I can't wait for the next one. I swore I would not get swept up in any more series books, but this one has really kept my interest and is very well written.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Over 18+...I herate cliffhangers so I'm glad I bought book 1 and 2 at the same time. I found no typos or editing mistakes which is always refreshing. The hero is unlikable and the the heroine is a liar so there is not a lot to get behind in this book. The chemistry between the two main characters is written very well and definitely sizzles. I really did not care for either character but the story flowed well and you keep reading hoping things will work out. There is a big ""grab"" at the end so you have  no choice but to get book 2.",4
B00JDYC5OI,Loved it! Every word! The only complaint is that it's too short. Good thing part two is coming out in a few weeks!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Interesting story that you have read before but with a twist or two to it. It's hard to say if you like the male lead, Andrew, or hate him. It leaves you hanging and of course wanting to find out the answer.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"It is a good story with a cliff hanger which I hate. I wish was longer. Im about to read the second one in this series,",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Loved Reasonable Doubt! Loved the characters and the plot, basically everything :) I can't wait for book 2, I'm on pins and needles!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Wow what a great read.  I can not wait for the next book in this awesome series.  I love Andrew!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Great potential in this first short story! Andrew is a dirty talker, a high-powered lawyer who had some bad experiences in his past which prevents him for dating in the real world. We are just tipping the iceberg of what those bad experiences might have been so I'm hanging by the edge of my seat. He picks up chicks for the night, sex only, on a match.com kind of website. Can you believe it - I've never read a book yet about characters hooking up through these match websites?? But Aubrey &#34;meets&#34; Andrew on a different website, like a Linked In for lawyers so it seems to be more legitimate. What I loved about this story is of course how hot Andrew is! He begins to talk to Aubrey over the phone and through text & he helps her with her career. They actually become good friends which is another thing I believe will hold our couple together in the end. Aubrey could get off just by hearing Andrew's dirty talk through the phone! I loved Andrew even when he was a hypocrite - it seems that Aubrey wasn't honest about who she really is & Andrew hates liars. OK dude, you used a fake name, you meet women all the time just for sex, etc. You aren't exactly honest either! Even when Andrew is angry & mean I loved him which is really good writing I must say. :) The ending just proves how little we know about Andrew's past & it is quite a juicy cliffhanger. But there is so much chemistry between Andrew & Aubrey that I can't wait to find out more!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I will read anything that Whit writes, she is that good.  My favorite book boyfriend is Jonathan from &#34;Mid-Life Love&#34;.  Now I am starting to like Andrew.  I am saying I am &#34;starting&#34; to like him because he is an arrogant, egotistical jerk who thinks he is God's gift.  I couldn't stand him at the start of the book and now he is beginning to grow on me.  I am sure by the time Whitney gets done with him and weaves her magic book writing spells I won't know how I ever lived without him. Finished the book in an evening and when I cameto the end was heartbroken because I wanted it to go on and on.  Luckily we won't have to wait long for the next installment.  Get busy writing Whitney, the anticipation is killing me.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I just completely yelled the title of this review, along with a &#34;NO&#34; when I finished this short story.I purchased it about 45 minutes ago, on a whim, after reading another review for it. I read the preview and I was hooked - blam, there goes $.99. GREAT money well spent. Please, please give me more?One author to another, I'm all but begging you.Okay, but seriously, please let me know when the next one's out. I NEED IT.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Loved this book but honestly it,was,way too short. Will definitely be getting the next book when it comes out. Highly recommend.",4
B00JDYC5OI,I love love this book. It is loaded with spades of sex. Andrew is scorn from something from Hispanic past. Andrew meets Alyssa online and befriended her thinking she is 27.  Alyssa who is actually Aurbery. Andrew hates lyers  and gives her a hard time when he finds out who she really is but can stop thinking about or wanting her except he has a lie of his own.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Purchased this book on the recommendation of a blogger I follow and was immediately hooked! I read it from start to finish in one sitting and never wanted it to end. And the ending? Oh baby! CANNOT WAIT for book 2!!!!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Great writing I am intrigued. Good start to character development. Good supporting characters. I like the writing style in this one.I hope the writing keeps up. I started to read her first book and was unable to finish it so I am hoping this one stays on the level of interest that it started with.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"If the blurb to this book doesn't grab your attention, you might want to consult your doctor. Having said that, this book was awesome! It's a shorter novella you can finish in one sitting. Andrew and Aubrey had me right away. It made me think of the the show Catfish on MTV and all the people that pretend to be someone they aren't as they hide behind their computer screen living in a fantasy world.This book weaves together a mysterious storyline that will leave you craving more of the arrogant Andrew that you can't help but find seriously sexy. His demands are in your face throughout most of the storyline. His desires are never down-played and most of all, his unique sense of humor will leave you shaking your head. The dynamic between him and Aubrey is intense and there is no room for excuses. Lies aren't tolerated and there are no apologies.Sometimes in life the things you crave the most are the worst for you. In other cases, you simply can't take no for an answer or demonstrate any sense of control when you need it most. You need to read this book to see for yourself everything the author has created. It's clever, fresh and will leave you wanting more! More Andrew, more Aubrey and more answers!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"If I could give this book 5+++++++++++++++++ stars I would, but 5's the limit...The description of this book wets your thirst for the story...but when you start drinking it in you will be &#34;drenched&#34; in more than one way ;-) I know I was and have no shame ;-)Andrew & Aubrey's relationship starts off in an anonymous lawyer group where you don't have to use your real name, but as you will read that is where the conflict starts and then one of them realizes they were lied to..and talk about being pissed!!. WHIT WHIT WHIT what can I say but Woman you can write Amazing Sex Scenes!! The sex scenes were so HOT that my legs where squeezing together tightly, I was seriously panting & needed to change my undies ( no shame in my sharing)Andrew & Aubrey's chemistry is HOT that you mightght need to let your Kindle cool down ;-) He hates what she did but once he gets a &#34;taste&#34; it's like they say you can't just have one chip, you need the whole bag ;-) and that damn cliffhanger...Whitney please I NEED MORE Andrew & Aubrey!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I came upon this book title thru Facebook and even tho have never heard of this Author before I had my Reasonable doubts , I decided, what the heck let's give it a chance .... Oh man , I'm not doubting anymore , boy, I was in for a very pleasant surprise ,  this story suck me right in because it's written from both main characters point of views so you get the whole story , what is going thru their minds and feelings , so it makes the book balance .. What a dirty mouth those two have .... Pew .... Hot , hot , hot ..... MELTING HOT . Sooo good I can't wait for the second book to come out .  Andrew, aka Thoreau  has spent the last several years man-whoring his way through all the women on various dating sites, He makes it clear from the beginning of each date that he is interested in only one thing ...&#34;Casual sex. Nothing more. Nothing less.&#34; Those are the exact words this lascivious hotter than hot lawyer  has posted on his dating profile in answer to the question &#34;What I'm looking for?&#34; .... He hates liars .. It makes you wonder why ?

You must read this book , it has a huge cliffhanger but damn is so good .",5
B00JDYC5OI,"It took the first chapter for me to realize that this was just going to be far too short for me...  Andrew Hamilton the arrogant ass is absolutely delicious.  I don't care that he uses women, not a bit... because when the bricks come tumbling down it's going to be absolutely delightful to read.The story moves at a lightening pace and my only worry is that 3 books isn't going to be enough.  There appears to be so much story to tell from both of the characters.The writing in this is good, the characters are engaging and they have some great dialogue. The scenes in this are steamy and even when you feel like you shouldn't like it, you just do.  I've already read the second book and wait impatiently for the third!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved this book.  It was a short read, but so worth it.  It was funny, true and what an ending.  I cant wait for the next book.  Two characters, so different, but so strong and stubborn.  I loved the story, the setting and just, well everything.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Loved this book! I hadn't read any of Whitney's books before and ended up reading all of her books this weekend! I cannot wait till the next one in the series!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved this. I must admit, at the beginning of the story, it didn't hold my attention. Once I got into the story, it was a fun read. I can't wait to read book two.",4
B00JDYC5OI,This book was great! I was so wrapped up in it that I couldn't put it down. I am anxiously awaiting the next book. I hate how short it was though. Definitely not long enough to get to know Andrew! I love the writing and will definitely check out more books by this author.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Not really sure what to say about RD. I mean besides, WOW, I think RD is a great book that will leave you wanting more.Andrew is a cocky, yet sexy, lawyer who wants what he wants and gets what he gets. Then he meets Aubrey/Alyssa-trust me you'll love this twist-and things change.The twists, turns and sexual tension is HOT HOT HOT! I love this book and can't wait for book 2!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I enjoyed Andrew&#8217;s brutal honesty in this book.  For .99 cents this book is short and awesome read, well worth the money.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to the second installment of the story the book left me wanting more.  At times in the story Andrew had me laughing out loud. No one could ever accuse him of being a liar.  Andrew's character acted more like a brat. He was very use to getting his way, but I liked him anyway.",5
B00JDYC5OI,What are you doing to me!?  You can't just leave me hanging like that!  It should be against some readers cruelty law or something!  I really really hope that #2 will be out soon and we won't have to wait a long time!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"What a awesome start to this 3 part series. I'm telling you, when u start it, you won't be able to set it aside. Love it...H/h are combustible and totally likeable and strong. Great character development.",5
B00JDYC5OI,This book was great!  I was able to read it fairly quickly and I like that.  I loved the characters.  I was totally blown away with how this book ended.  I need the next ones ASAP!  You should read it -,5
B00JDYC5OI,"As always when I read a new author for the first time I go in with my eyes wide open and not too many expectations. Well WGW definitely exceeded my expectations&#8230;..this is a cool read!! I most certainly was not disappointed&#8230;.except maybe a little with the length (a measly 78 pages&#8230;..explains the .99c price tag) I finished this in one sitting. This was a sassy, smutty, slightly angsty roller coaster read that had me engaged from the first paragraph. Phew, what a dirty mouth Mr Hamilton has&#8230;&#8230;talk about a naughty, naughty boy!! Andrew Hamilton is crass, extremely forward and slightly infuriating when it comes to his interactions with women until he meets Alyssa (Aubrey Everhart) online and things for him change. Aubrey is a sweet, sexy ballerina/ pre-law student hiding behind an online profile, posing as a full fledged lawyer. When she applies for an internship at Mr Hamilton&#8217;s firm things come to a head and jeez it goes off with a bang but be warned it leaves you on a cliff hanger and I am desperate to see how this whole thing unravels. Hopefully we don&#8217;t have to wait much longer for Volume 2.~Nice and Naughty Book Club~",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Just when the story was getting good that was the end. I would have liked for there to be more in this book. Very disappointed that there,wasn't more of a story going on.",3
B00JDYC5OI,I loved this story and can not wait until the next one to see how it continues.  When I started reading it I did not know that it was a series and it does leave you hanging.  Great story though.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow! What a rollercoaster ride. Thrilling, sexy, slightly angsty. Andrew is infuriating and all alpha lawyer. Aubrey is a sexy ballerina/ pre law student. I'm hooked. Looking forward to book 2. FYI cliffhanger.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew has a filthy, filthy mouth, and I love that!  I'm on the fence with the girl though, she is a bit of a dolt.  But, the story line was interesting and original, and the cliffhanger is a doozie, so I will be reading the next book in the series.  All in all, a short, but good read.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I am hooked.  I loved the Mid-Life Love novels and Jonathan was such a sexy, sweet man.  Now Andrew Hamilton, holy hotness....he is such a naughty, naughty boy and I loved every word out of his dirty mouth!  I almost yelled out loud when I read the last line of the episode - I just knew she was going to leave us hanging there.  Whitney you are certainly building the anticipation for episode 2.  Thank you again for these fabulous stories that take us out of reality and into our fantasies..",5
B00JDYC5OI,"loved this book, couldn't put it down.  just the take is from him is hot. second is also great.  can't wait for more",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was an awesome impulse buy for me. The hero in this book is an arrogant prick with a filthy mouth. I LOVED that about him. The heroine is a complex but slightly clueless creature that seems more fragile than she is. At least, that's how she came across to me. At first. The more that I read, the more I started to like her. This was a great start to a trilogy and I hope that the wait isn't too long for the next book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,there are so many things i can say about this book and it wont even do it justice i loved this book and i am becoming impatient waiting for the next one Whitney Garcia Williams Kudos to you please release the book soon i cant wait,5
B00JDYC5OI,first time ive read this author's work and it was just what I needed! love the witty dialogue and Aubrey's personality. sooooo looking forward to the next!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"it was a quick read, a little quicker than I had hoped. but good none the less...I hope the next one comes out just as quickly!",4
B00JDYC5OI,it was short book . but a good line story. I can't wait for the second book to come out.,5
B00JDYC5OI,ahhh this book was fantastically hot!! I loved both these characters. I thought there witty sexy banter was hilarious!!! Can't wait for the next!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Great read..I couldn't put it down. but just when the book got good it was the end....I'm not a fan of short books..I love the long novels...so my only grip about this book is it is to to short.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"I began reading this book, and it seemed kind of run of the mill beginning.  As I kept reading I was totally enveloped in the story.  I began thinking of how from internet contact, people still want human contact, they need it.The story line credible and the interaction between the main characters is sooooooo hot and funny!!!! Really liked and could not stop reading it!!!!! Definitely recommend it!! Can't wait for part two.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I didn't realize this was a serial. I'll definitely be picking up the rest of the series as soon as they're available!,4
B00JDYC5OI,"I the way the author told the story from the the leading characters point of view. I can't wait to see what happens with Andrew, Aubrey and his wife.",5
B00JDYC5OI,ok..I was on a fb page and a lady was talking about this book and stated how HAWT it was.. so I had to give it a try..let me say..if I could give it more then 5 stars I would..freaking luved this book!  I read it in a few hours lmao. I can't wait for book 2!!  goodness it was HAWT! =) u won't b disappointed!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,This book was a quick read. This was a hot one! I am excited for book two. Definitely gonna read the next one!,5
B00JDYC5OI,You must read this.  Wow.  Written incredibly well and super steamy.  I am loving Andrew.  I need more.  Hurry up #2,5
B00JDYC5OI,Every book she writes gets better and better.  You have to love a book that puts you out of your comfort zone.  Can't wait for the next installment.  This is one book you won't be able to put down.,5
B00JDYC5OI,The amen was that???? That was a tease but a good one! This story is short and you will feel like you need book two yesterday! Loved it,5
B00JDYC5OI,so glad this was just 99 cents. Just too unbelievable for me to take seriously....and no plot whatsoever...none.  A complete waste of time.,2
B00JDYC5OI,Holy **** this book was awesome !!!! loved it... need more like now! **** me wow!!! I loveee Andrew and his dirty mouth...yummm. you won't regret buying this book! 10 huge gold stars for me!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Read this book if you like hot men and hot hook ups.  I was just getting into the story when it was over!  I dislike super short installments.  The main character, Andrew, is hard to like. Only after he starts to break his rules do you realize he really doesn't Iike himself either.  This is when the book gets good. Aubrey is likable at first. She holds her own before she ever meets Andrew. After they meet, she turns into an easy intern. Just not in her original character.  The book ends in a huge cliffhanger, so be prepared.  Overall, the story was fun, but felt like just a chapter.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"I have never heard of or read a book by this author before, but I can say that I am now a fan of her work. No offence to those published authors out there, living their dream and feeding their families, but sometimes self-published novels have an air and quality about them that published ones can't measure to. I always say, that &#34;starving&#34; artiste (I mean that in a good way), normally produce some of the best works.Without a reasonable doubt, I can say that I enjoyed this story. I love the characters, detail, story line and development. For the first time, I could actually manage them throwing each other up against walls, without rolling my eyes to the sky. The thing that has me weary, is her wanted career path. I am one of those persons who ALWAYS have a plan B and thoroughly believe in stability. Therefore, I kind of want her to be committed to being a lawyer.I like all the characters so far and even the cliches are tolerable. There isn't much spin or twist to the story line from others of it's genre and subject matter, but there is something about Aubrey and Andrew that makes you fall in love with them and exclude them from the group some people would say they are firmly apart of.Andrew is a douche to everyone but Alyssa; He is witty, intelligent, sarcastic, sexy, possibly and introvert and quite the dirty talker. I don't mind that this novel has two POVs, but I currently slightly prefer Andrew to Aubrey's POV. He got me from the first page and I just kept on yearning for him right down to the last.Aubrey is quite the hellcat when provoked and I love her &#34;honesty&#34;, I say this tentatively. She adds fire and intensity, she is outspoken, confident and it completely baffles me, as to her lack of friends. I loved her instantly and her banters with Andrew are hilarious, spicy and always end with some arousing kink free sex. It's raw, gritty, passionate, unexpected and in just the right amount of doses.This novel is all about pace; You have to pace yourself for Andrew's, past and the demons he are trying to outrun. You also have to pace yourself with regards to their future, because Andrew's past is unknown and the present is murky at best.I love the details and time placed in each conversation and scene. I am actually shocked that this is novella length, because so much is packed in there without you paying attention to the length. I have learnt so much about and from both, while still waiting on the superglue to tie everything together. Maybe Andrew will lend me some off his office floor :)The ending is unfortunately firmly in cliffhanger territory. I'm not gonna front like I'm not disappointed, as his secrets are crawling from their holes and his reaction after Aubrey's last revelation is definitely on my mind. I am thinking up all sort of scenarios at this point and dying to meet the new addition, as well as, to figure out what took the hot shot New York lawyer to North Carolina.There is many more to learn and experience with Andrew and Aubrey. I love them as individuals and as a couple, which I believe is important in romance novels of this nature. If the characters don't know themselves, how will we know?Their story flows while it brings heat, sexiness, mystery and joy. There is always something happening or being revealed and the main relationship dynamic, has me excited in a way I haven't been in awhile with new stories.I hope the continuation will keep this momentum and I can't wait to see what book 2 brings. Hopefully, it's a little longer, because I have fallen in love with fire and fire; It can make the biggest blaze we have ever seen or it can burn until it fizzles. I personally am voting for the first option, so I shall cross my fingers and toes until the next installment.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"A bit over dramatic, and a lot unprofessional, but I was entertained for a $.99 impulse purchase. I'll be reading episode 2.",3
B00JDYC5OI,To quick a read I want more and soon. I love good humor and well written banter. Read it you will not regret it!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Too much for me to handle! That's all I've got to say! Secrets and lies. Deception! Oh this was a wonderful first book. I was invested from the very beginning and cannot wait for more! Highly recommend!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is one Hott read! The description had me going crazy for this book! So of course I one clicked and was I pleased or what! One hottie lawyer looking for one nighters , and one girl looking for answers online....they collide in cyber world...What could happen? Hottness is what! This was an awesome short read with humor ,a little suspense and oh yeah a lot of sexiness! Whitney G totally dilivered and had me aching for more! Cant wait to read the next installment!",5
B00JDYC5OI,This is a short book with more parts to come - lol.  Very hot story about a lawyer and a college intern.  I cannot wait for next part!!!!  Did I mention it's HOT?,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was my first time reading Ms. Williams and she's Awesome!!  First off, I don't usually read short novellas because I like longer books but once I read the blurb, I had to download this story due to my curiosity!  What a HAWT read with some spicy, smexy scenes and then I read the next line that I didn't know was the LAST line & said WTF??!!  Had to go back and reread it to make sure my eyes didn't get it wrong.  Wowza!  I can't wait for the next one in the series. You should definitely be reading this book!!  Highly recommend! :-))",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reasonable Doubt by Whitney G. Williams5 StarsSo as most of you know, I, Ladyballs very rarely give 5 star reviews.  You also know that I don&#8217;t like to read a bunch of short books that equal a series.  Actually, I HATE it.  Well, let&#8217;s mark the calendars people, because today I DO!  Reasonable Doubt rocked it out!  I effing loved it and could not put it down. I totally got sucked into it and the world around me seemed to cease because it was so intriguing. Because it&#8217;s not too long, I will make this short and sweet, or try to.Andrew is a lawyer, a good one at that, works for one of the top law firms around and he is hot, smoking hot.  Like with most hot, successful men he is a full blown d*&khead.;  He has a different flavor of the week and is a &#8220;hit it and quit it&#8221; type of guy.  The way he treats women makes me want to ball punch him but by the end of the story I may or may not of had a ladyboner for him.  I think in the next book we will find out why he is such a douche canoe towards women.Ok, so, he is trolling dating websites to look for one night stands or with him weekly stands and is definitely getting his money worth.  Him and his huge c*&k; seem to have a voracious appetite for vagina. The only drawback to being on this site he is finding is that people are liars.  They are not who they seem to be and he has been on more than one date where the person he saw a profile picture of is not the person he is meeting and it is PISSING him off!  He is ALSO on a site for &#8220;lawyers&#8221; that you actually need to get an invitation to join, from other lawyers.  This is where he meets &#8220;Alyssa&#8221;, a supposed lawyer.  She is smart, sassy and can go toe to toe with him in the flirtation department.  They have been online friends for about six months and he truly looks forward to his conversations with her.  They discuss all topics and lately he has been giving her advice about some cases she has had. And you guessed it, they have never met!Enter Aubrey.  A twenty two year old law student who is looking to get an internship at any of the top law firms in the area.  She is hot, smart and sassy&#8230;ring any bells&#8230;ding ding ding.  There is also a back story to her but you can go read the book to find out what that is. Well, can you guess where she gets an interview to intern at?  Can you guess who is one of the partners at the law firm interviewing her?  Can you guess who starts to put two and two together during said interview by the very specific answers she is giving.  Answers that he gave a certain lawyer friend on the phone last night!!!!I can&#8217;t ruin the fun for you&#8230;S*** hits the fan when this happens and the rest of the book is the outcome and shenanigans after this interview.  I will say that the sex scenes are hot, hot, hot and as arrogant as Andrew is, I was crushing hard by the end of the book for some reason.  I need, need, need the next book out like now because the way this book ended made me want to scream and hulk smash my kindle in a thousand pieces that I couldn&#8217;t read what happens next!! AHHHHHH...hurry Whitney, please hurry! I highly recommend reading this little gem.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew (Thoreau) is a lawyer who makes his intentions to every woman clear- he wants one night only, and he wants it his way. He can't stand liars and typically only goes for one type of female- blond with blue eyes and long legs- until he meets &#34;Alyssa&#34; online who claims to be a red head. Suddenly he must have her and does everything possible to meet her face to face. She doesn't want his body, just his help, but when a sudden turn of fate pushes them together lines are crossed and secrets are suddenly revealed.This book really disappointed me. I liked the premise, but the execution was off the mark. I had too little time to get to know the characters, so when the conflict appeared I didn't feel anything towards those involved. Detail was lacking in some scenes, so in some cases I really had no idea where anyone was. Labelled as a romance, I also expected more of a love interest to spark, but only saw lust between the two characters.'Alyssa' tried to claim she was a strong woman but proved she was instead incredibly meek, under even slightly uncomfortable situations. She went to Thoreau so often for advice that I began to wonder if she could truly think for herself. Andrew was very hypocritical and far too pushy for my liking.The ending was so wild and with absolutely no build up, that I knew right away it was a ploy for a long stand novella series. I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this book to anyone, as it still needs too much work. Perhaps if the author comes out with a full length novel I will try something by her again as the story was written well and had a fantastic editor.",1
B00JDYC5OI,"I'm so happy that I read this book!!!!! it's so unbelievably awesome! the premise of the story is great, amazing characters, great dialogue, STEAMY SEX SCENES equals one amazing book!!! it ends on a cliffhanger and I really wish it didn't cause I just more right right right NOW!! Can't wait for episode 2 and 3 ! Squeals!!!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Honestly, I may be in the minority here, but I'm not that fond of trilogies.  Once I read my happily ever after, I usually don't want to continue the story. Also, trilogies start to drag and ultimately frustrate me.  This story is an exception.  I won't cover much of the plot since it's been covered already.  Andrew is so cynical when it comes to women and relationships so I loved that he finally opened up to a woman.  When he was betrayed, it hit him hard.  I really felt Aubrey's regret when she realized she may have lost Andrew due to her deception.  Even though the first story left me with the dreaded cliff-hanger, I can't wait to read book #2.  Don't doubt it - you'll really like this book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I devoured this in one sitting. It's so good. Fast paced and hot as hell and sizzling with tension. Can not wait to next book,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Not to sound cliche, but I don't read serials.  I heard a lot of awesomeness about this book and just had to check it out for myself.  Loved this.  It's a quick read, great humor.  I'm just surprised Andrew didn't put the pieces together sooner.  Great read!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I absolutely loved this book.  I love the witty, smart mouthed, head-strong Aubrey.  I love that she doesn't take any crap from anyone.  We need to be reading about more women like this!!!  Her jerk of a boss (and online friend) Andrew is so bad that he's good!  God this was fun.  Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was so fantastic that I'm freaking out because the next one isn't available. Very well written. Flows perfectly. Keeps you glued and on edge because you have no idea what will happen next...The only downside? It's a novella and it's only just enough book to get you interested. That's the sucky part. I may also think that the price for this isn't nearly reasonable considering it's very, very short... but to each their own on that one. I however am not that concerned since it turns out it wasn't a waste at all.This book is currently sitting at #2 on Amazon's best sellers and I easily figured out how this happened.I'm not going to go to much into this book since it's so short, I'll probably end up spoiling it somehow... but the bottom line is that if you are looking for an erotic romance that going to make you blush as well as grin broadly... then this one is the book for you.I'm labeling it as a new adult erotic romance - since the characters are fairly young but it contains reasonable amount of erotic content. I wouldn't say it's entirely erotic since I found it only bordering an erotic theme. So even if you aren't into the hot and heavy that adult erotic romance's offer... you should still enjoy this one and find it damn sexy, utterly gripping and totally naughty without being crass.Rating: 5 Stars! I recommend this!",5
B00JDYC5OI,OMG!! I loved this! I seriously can not wait till the next part of this series! beware it is a cliffhanger. But holy moly its Hot!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"So, just as an FYI, this is a novella (shorter than a novel). Also, it ends on a cliffhanger (which isn't so bad for this one, but the third book isn't out, so I'm biting my fingernails waiting for that).That being said, I really enjoyed this story. There are a few things, some of the dynamics between the two, that I feel aren't explained quite right, but I also know that there are more parts to this story. With the ending, I was glad that I was able to dive right into the next one.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"While scrolling through the best sellers on the Kindle list, I stumbled across this book and I'm glad I did. The alpha male in the book isn't the nicest guy in the world but you can obviously tell he has a good heart. The heroine isn't the most lovable but you get the sense that she's trying to find her way being torn between her true passion and her parents' dream for her. These two make for one of the hottest short stories I've read in a very long time.I love the way the book is split by law definitions and that the definition fits perfectly for each chapter. I didn't catch any obvious mistakes and the writing was great. The only thing I didn't like was the biggest cliffhanger at the end. It drove me a little crazy and now I can't wait for the next part. Hopefully it's really soon.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Andrew is a lawyer.  He loves sex.  He loves anonymous sex with women he'll never see ever again.  Preferably blondes, who want a good romp, and those who pass on after-sex-cuddles.  &#34;One time, and never again&#34; is his motto, and he lives by it.  That, and he HATES liars.  For any reason.Now meet &#34;Alyssa.&#34;  Andrew's one and only &#34;friend.&#34;  She's a wanna-be ballerina who is going to law school to appease her important lawyer parents.  When she goes to a major law firm to interview for an intern position, both her and Andrew's worlds will turn upside down.Steamy sex, interesting characters full of witty banter, and a jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending.  I can't wait to see how number two plays out!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I enjoyed the story. A solid 3.5 for me! I personally thought it was a bit short for myself and would have preferred more of a story line to it. I think it is a good start though to the series. It just was so short that once you started to get into it and hope some story was happening other then sex that it was over. Overall good start to the series, just needed to be longer and have more of a storyline.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"This was such a hot read!  I loved the character development, the banter between the characters, and the boss/employee relationship.  This was the first book I've read by Whitney Gracia Williams, but it will most definitely not be my last!  Can't wait until book 2!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"The minute I started reading this book, I know that it's a keeper! I could not put it down! I had a little inkling that she was up to something! The interview scene was the most hilarious for me! Andrew's suspicions and finally realization!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Okay I have to say I absolutely loved this book and the sex scenes were hot!!!!  Someone spray me down with some ice cold water...I can't wait for the next book....I love the story line..I loved the interview that was my favorite part and did not see that coming....great job...I read it within an hour...,5
B00JDYC5OI,"4.5 stars.  I would have given it 5, but since it was part of a series and the other parts are not out yet, I only gave it 4.5. I don't like it when authors release books in 3 parts when they could have easily been one good book.With all of that said....Wow! This little book packs a punch! It is a very quick read, and be warned that the male character, Andrew, is a foul-mouthed, arrogant attorney who is only interested in one-night stands.  He uses an internet dating site and the women he's with know where he stands.  It is a sizzling book that is over too quickly.It has a cliff-hanger, but it's not too irritating because the book is so short that you're not that invested when it ends.  Plus, the other two books in the series are supposed to be out soon.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I have just finished reading Reasonable Doubt. And all I can say is WOW!!  I devoured this book in one sitting. Couldn't stop reading Until the very last word. From the very first page until the very last  word, I was hooked. The writing was smooth and flowed effortlessly. The storyline was believable. The main characters were wonderfully developed, and I felt like I understood them.As someone who has visited and participated in online dating sites, I could totally relate to Aubrey. As a matter of fact, some situations in the book hit VERY close to home. The end result of my little experiment with online dating was a relationship with a man, kind of like Andrew in some ways, that lasted for years. No ring, is why he is an ex. No HEA for us as a couple, but we are still friends, and still communicate with one another on a regular basis.OMG! What a cliffhanger! Why did you have to torture us this way, Whit? Why?I cannot wait to read book 2. Whitney Grace Williams you are my favorite new author.Take notes E.L. James, and all the rest, this is how it's done.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Thoroughly enjoyed reading this.  I liked Andrew's directness and boldness.  My mouth dropped open at the ending.  I look forward to reading the next installment.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"And I can't wait for the sequel!  This is a new author for me and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this book.  It's a great combination of intelligent characters, dirty-mouth lawyer, HOT sex scenes, with a couple of funny lines thrown in.  Of course the last page ended with a cliff hanger, which I didn't mind because I know I'm going to buy the sequel as soon as it's available.  By the way, when is that??  While I searched for other books by this author as soon as I finished RD, I liked the story line of Midlife Love and saw the number of 4-5 stars so I bought it!  Now I've got about 10 new books to work on...  Amazon, stop recommending books to me &#34;based on your recent purchase&#34; already!!  Haha...",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was an enjoyable, quick read. A bit formula (hot, emotionally unavailable, alpha lawyer who likes a bit of kink in his sex, beautiful young college girl) but I still liked it...a lot. I must like that formula stuff, lol. Pretty good character development for such a short read, but not a whole lot to the story. I won't hold that against Ms. Williams, for the length of the story and the genre it worked. Cliff hanger at the end, definitely will be reading books 2 and 3....",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Read this one !!!!!  Sexy, sexy, sexy!!!  Great story line and very erotic!!!  Can't wait until book 2 & 3 !!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book is so, so, good, not erotica, but better.  A good book, good story, great h and H, can't wait for the follow-up....buy this book....it is one of the best love stories I have ever read.  Thanks for the privilege.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book is simply fabulous, and I completely loved it. It has sass, plenty of humor, delicious dirty-talk and some very steamy scenes. I'm very much looking forward to the following 2 books.This is a serial, and it ends on a cliffhanger, so if that's not your thing, you should probably wait to read them until all 3 parts are out. But once they are out you should grab them and savor them, because this serial will entertain the hell out of you ;)",5
B00JDYC5OI,"When I'm not familiar with an author, I purchase my fiction based on reviews, book description, and cover in that order. For this particular book it was the book description that sealed the deal. I typically try and wait for book trilogies to be completely published or at least have two of them out before I start reading them, but I made an exception for this book and am kicking myself for it as we speak! Why? Because I'm stalking the author for any updates on the release (maybe an early one:) of the second book AND because I've tried reading two other books after this one, while I wait for the 2nd, and have stopped reading them both! This book has ruined me for all other books until I can finish the series.The chemistry between the two leads in this book is off the charts and the dialogue is so well written, that I really believe I am listening to one of the many arrogant lawyers I happened to have gone to college with. She nails the male POV. Trust me:) He's a jerk and he's yummy all at the same time! The cliffhanger was great and I'm looking forward to seeing where the story is going.",5
B00JDYC5OI,All I can say is WOW!! The chemistry between Aubrey and Andrew was amazing! I read it in one sitting with each page turned I couldn't wait to see how the story unravels between these two.  Then I got to the end (WHAT A CLIFFHANGER!!!!) Even if I knew it would of been cliffhanger I would of still read this amazing book looking forward for the 2nd book like NOW!!! I wish there were more stars to rate this book because it deserve much more than 5 stars.Happy ReadingLisa,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book was ridiculous (in the best way possible), fantastic, and thrilling.  I had no idea what to expect.  I was overwhelmed with the characters; how unique and tantalizing these two are.  They were unbelievably spectacular.  So well thought out and pieced together.  Each having their own special trait that pulls you to them.  Each fulfilling that role that they are playing to perfection.  And each being unique and twisted.  Author Whitney Garcia Williams wrote a masterpiece novella, that is the first book of a brilliant serial.  Sure it's 78 pages, and it doesn't seem like it can be enough to satiate that hunger for a full length novel.  BUT, not only was I satiated, I was tickled pink.  Here's the thing, I usually stray away from novellas that are under 100 pages, because I feel like everything that needs to be conveyed won't be.  Well, it conveys everything you NEED to KNOW to feel COMPLETE!  Scurry over and one click this beauty.  YOU CANNOT PASS IT UP!!  Pure Awesomeness!!",5

B00JDYC5OI,"This book had me hooked! Good read, I devoured it in a couple of hours, only bad thing is no book #2 in sight!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was very much waiting for this book and it was more than worth the wait! Whitney's books just keep getting better and better! The dialogue is always witty and sexy and you can just feel everything her characters are going through like you're right there with them-this makes an excellent writer for me. Whitney Gracia Williams  has and will continue to be one of my go-to authors the minute a new one comes out! Thanks for the awesome ride Whitney!,5
B00JDYC5OI,Enjoyed this quick read. Patiently awaiting the nextinstallment.in this series...worth the time and 99 cents.. I will read more of this author's work.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this book, but boy am I convinced now!  Cannot wait for Reasonable Doubt 2.  The cliffhanger was one that you never see coming.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was hooked from the first word and read it in one sitting. Whitney has written some if my favorite books and this series will be added to the list. Can't wait for book two!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG!!!!! I CANNOT GET OVER HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS!!! Yes, I&#8217;m using shout-y CAPS. This book is way more than shout-y caps worthy! This is FLIPPING FANTASTIC! SEXY, FABULOUS, HOT! You definitely WANT to read this! It&#8217;s dripping with sexual tension, dirty talk, and total awesomeness. This is a fabulous start to the series. And, I need more NOW!The blurb really does tell you all that you need to know. Just wait until you find out what happens when Andrew realizes just who Alyssa is.Andrew&#8230;. He's yummy, delicious, and a complete a-hole. He has a dirty mouth.... filthy even. He&#8217;s sexy, hot, and smart. He's blunt, bold, and can make a girl wet in less than 10 words. Andrew is what he is and makes no excuse for it. He&#8217;s the best cocky a-hole I&#8217;ve ever come across in a book. So, YES&#8230;. I. NEED. MORE. ANDREW.Reasonable Doubt is fabulous right out of the starting gate, but with the way it ended it's about to get even better. Bring on Episode 2 Whitney!(This book is part of a serial so keep that in mind before you say it&#8217;s short. It&#8217;s like watching a tv series&#8230;. you just need to wait for the season finale, that&#8217;s all.)",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I didn't know this was a series and it would end like it did. Whitney, you're fingers better be bandaged and typing. I need to know what happens next.Loved the snarky chemistry between these 2!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I read this so fast and wanted more! Very good writing and the story just kept going! Loved Andrew's brutal personality!!! I am not good at writing reviews, just know that this was yet another outstanding story from Whitney! i can't wait for the next one and the next one and so on!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Cannot wait for the next instalment..Whitney G. Is one of my faves..couldn't wait to start this one.Andrew is scrumptious he is such a bad boy.Csnnot wait for all his secrets to be revealed..,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Hot, sexy, funny, total swoon worthy alpha male! Loved this book and dying for book 2! A great read - I fully intend on reading again by the pool this summer!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"If you haven't 1-clicked this book purely from the blurb alone, what are you waiting for!!! IT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT and then some!!!! Andrew will leave you a HOT PANTING MESS, jaw dropped and begging for more, literally (I wish I could show you a picture of my face, you know that one...that YOU HAVE GOT TO BE EFFIN KIDDING ME LOOK!)Whitney's writing style is like no other! It is twisted, heart-stopping & panty melting and that is just putting it mildly!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Seriously, fast and hard. The book comes at u. Andrew was a dick but can make your panties drop. I love the banter between the two and of course the chemistry. Very interested in what happens next and I hope it will not go down hill.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"After experiencing a reading drought and having few real options to choose from. Few of which had the same old storyline...meeting the girl/guy of your dreams and not being able to resist, this was a refreshing change with an unexpected twist. I'm waiting with bated breath for book 2 and check daily for its release day; such is the influence of Reasonable Doubt.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I loved this book!  I can't wait for book 2!  Andrew is so hot!  I can't wait to find out what's going to happen in book 2!  Amazing!  Highly recommend!,5
B00JDYC5OI,I bought this book because I liked the description and it was great. I would of given it five stars but it is a cliff hanger. I hate cliff hangers and liked to be warned prior to reading so I know what I'm in for.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"The only negative I have to say on this book is the length......I wish authors would just write these types of books as one novel instead of 2-4 small parts.  I got just enough to really get into it and then....BAM see you in a few months with the next couple chapters.Hot story and I do love how things between the characters happened!  I will read the next part, because damn did she leave me hanging!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I would have given this five stars!!!!  if it was a full book!!! Smh I have no patience! I want to sit down and read, to get lost in the story specially from a good author!!! & this is a good author!!  she can write!!  I guess I'll await for the full story to buy it!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Once I had read the blurb, I was really looking forward to read this one and what a pleasant surprise is to have your expectations overachieved.This is a quick read, not just because of its length but from the first page you'll get hook with the story and the characters, the chemestry between the MCs and the banter was just addictive and the flow it has throughout the story will have you reading this in just a few hours. This was sexy, witty, amazingly written and hot  with a mean ending (cliffhanger), but not to worry, we won't have to wait too long to have the whole story unfold in the next couple of months.I think Ms Williams has proven to be an amazing author giving this short book the depths and wholesomeness that a full lenght novel would provide. I just can't wait to see where this story about lies and secrets will lead us.If you like conceited, blunt, foul mouthed, alpha male lawyer you will love to meet Andrew and his affair with witty and sassy pre-law student/ballerina Aubrey will simply scorh the pages away in this read.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Andrew and Aubrey meet on a chat board and talk and text and Email for almost six months when lies come out for an intern ship. Things move fast because Andrew hates liars and cuts them out of his life. But something about her changes things. Great book. Starting next one.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Loved the concept, but this book was too short and ended in a cliffhanger so I was disappointed.  Just when I was getting to know the characters, it was over.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"Once again, Whitney G has put her heart and soul into words that will pull you into a story and characters that will have you so entwined in their lives that you will not want to put this book down once you have picked it up.  Andrew is the ultimate Alpha male who likes to control the SEX and the women he is with BUT Alyssa isn't a woman he can control or even who she says she really is.....right???  Stop reading this and go buy the book!!! It's delicious!!  5 star delicious!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Omg I have a handheld fan out & that's not doing a very good job at cooling me down after reading this. The book was hot hot hot Whitney, I'm surprised my kindle didn't spontaneously combust because I almost did lol. Loved it even though Andrew  could be a bit of an ass, I actually liked the text messaging from Theroux better lol well almost I meann phone sex is great but nothing beats the real thing. Awesome job, cant wait for next for the sequel. Only criticism too short lol",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Hello Andrew Hamilton!!! A very quick read, but man was  that H-O-T!!! In such a quick time, this author managed to draw me in and wrap me up in these characters - I am dying to know what happened in Andrew's past, and what will happen with Aubrey.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy Smoke, this book is a HOT one! After seeing so many high recommendations for Reasonable Doubt and the sexy, dirty talkin Andrew Hamilton I had to find out if the book and the book boyfriend were as great as proclaimed. And I have to say that I was not disappointed. This book and Mr. Hamilton are oh soooo sexy and I can't wait for more!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"HARSH, SEXY, ADDICTIVE and IMPRESSING WELCOME TO ONE OF MY NEW FAVOURITE BOOK-SERIES!This story is definitely one of my favourite and very addictive to every book-junkie! So after that CLIFF - I need more (like yesterday?), I mean: &#34;M.O.R.E.&#34; of Andrew and Aubrey! Yeez, you know that feeling when after reading first page you know - YOU F* KNOW - that you will be glued to this book and you will devour EVERY F* WORD IN THIS BOOK! Yep. Finally, after reading M. Pierce, I have had this feeling, again! Thanks Whitney, I love every sentence, every thought and every f* reasonable doubt in the first Volume and can't wait for you to surprise me and to even more fall in love with your second book!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is my toned down Amazon review. You can check the real one on Goodreads or All Romance ReviewsThis was so good! I don't normally go for novellas but WhitG is one of those authors that will make me not only read a novella, but walk away loving it. No difference here.Remember- this is a serial so the stories will be short and you need to get all 3 to have the full story but she is churning these bad boys out quickly, so be patient.Andrew is so freakin' hot I thought I was going to spontaneously combust from the chemistry here. And then &#34;Alyssa&#34; is really a likeable female lead and you just can't help but root for her.You want to hate Andrew. Then you want to forgive him. Then you're mad again and then all of a sudden you're like &#34;please come knocking on my door and do wicked things, Andrew. Please. For the love of God, please.Just get this book. It'll take you like- no time at all to zip through it- and then you'll be like me- stalking WhitG on the regular for more. It's fine- she likes stalkers I think.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Gotta love Andrew Hamilton, a hot shot, sexy as hell lawyer with trust issues and Aubrey Everhart a smart, sexy prelaw student/ ballerina...they are brought together by a webb of lies, but, they have this crazy chemistry as if they are drawn to each other, with this crazy attraction.  Will they let the lies keep them apart or will they work thru the BS and see what is next for them....I desperately need to read Reasonable Doubt 2, I gotta know what happens with the hot, sexy Andrew Hamilton.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy moly, this was one heck of a page turner! Okay, now I'm left wanting the next part of the story right now. Andrew isn't asking for anything complicated, as a matter of fact, he thrives on simplicity and detachment as long as honesty is involved. He demands the truth no matter what. Once he discovers Alyssa's lies, things move into that complicated territory. Andrew had me laughing at times, he is so crude and most definitely rude. He's also intelligent, attractive and very direct. Alyssa could definitely play coy, but she is actually sweet for the most part. Still, there's more sides of Alyssa to be revealed in the future. This was so good, I loved it.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow I really liked part 1. I read the sample, it was good, but I wasn't sure where the story was going. Since this is part one the sample was pretty short and didn't really give you any hints on what was to come. I read a couple of book blogger on my FB saying the loved the book and why not try for only $0.99? I thought hey why not I'll give it a shot... SO GLAD I DID, could not put it down, I am hooked. How long until the next one comes out?First we meet Andrew and it's obvious that he has got something in his past that has made him the way he is today, we get bits and pieces alluding to what is still haunting him, but not a lot of detail I can only assume that will come as the story progresses. One thing he makes perfectly clear is he HATES liars (I don't blame him that is my number one pet peeve). He only hooks up with women, only once and if he finds out your a liar you don't even get that.I don't want to give too much away, but this is worth the read, buy it now. I really need to know when the next one is being released. Book hangover goes away quicker when reading the next book already...",5
B00JDYC5OI,Oh my goodness....What a very sexy and different book.  Not sure what to say other than this book is a great diversion from real life. If you like reading about sexy dominant men who can't make up their mind....this is the book for you.  It is a cliffhanger.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I'm not a novella series type of girl but.... OH MY this was awesome. It reminded me of the movie you've got mail. Emails sent, texts sent,  phone calls and then the big reveal. I'm so glad I bought this book. I'm also glad in don't have to wait a full year for the next one.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reasonable Doubt by Whitney Gracia Williams was a quick, entertaining read. I liked the way the author named her chapters vs going with the traditional ONE, TWO, blah blah... it was quirky and telling about what it was that you were about to get into. I was kind of disappointed in the shortness of the book, but that was because I was loving the dynamic between the characters and wanted MORE. Not a bad thing, just a book whore's worst nightmare! CLIFFY!!!So, we start the book with Andrew, he is going for a much needed fresh start. We catch up to him six years into the fresh start and he's still up to his man-whore ways. His rules. One and done. Meaning, one dinner, one date, one lay and done. Let's just say our boy has issues and he was burned badly by someone... dun dun dun!!  No we don't really find out anything about what happened other than he hates liars. So, we have to assume he was lied to and by a woman....Aubrey... well... she is a law student and a ballerina. One is her dream, the other a means to an end. I can't tell you much about this girl without spoiling things, but I will say that she and Andrew have some serious chemistry. Like set someone on fire... flames fire... and the smexy kind of fire comes later.Reasonable Doubt is chopped full of sexual tension, character angst, and flirtatious banter. If you are looking for a quick, sexy read then I would suggest this one for sure. I can't wait to pick up the next one.  I give it FOUR STARS for storyline and FOUR drenched panties on the smut scale!Review by the Head Whore at Mommy's a Book Whore.**Amazon Verified Purchase**",4
B00JDYC5OI,"4.5 stars. I loved everything about this serial. The dialogue in particular was awesome. Yes, Andrew was a jerk and Alyssa was a liar, but I truly enjoyed every page of their story. Andrew was so infuriatingly cocky, and I hoped that Alyssa would be the woman to put him in his place. He has secrets, and I am dying to know what they are. Alyssa was great. I enjoyed how she always said exactly what she felt, and I think she could definitely give Andrew a run of his money. The way the two met and their interactions were so entertaining, and I am definitely looking forward to more.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I wasn't expecting much, but this was an really good read. I'm just sad that it was so short. And!  I didn't realise that it was only just released, so now I have to wait ages for the next one?! Boo! Definitely recommend!",4
B00JDYC5OI,This was great but leaves you hanging can't wait for the next book .. Wow give me more !! What will happen next ??!!,4
B00JDYC5OI,i picked this book up for a filler to read till another book was released.  i'm so happy i did - it was a great short read but left you with a cliffhanger -  i cant wait for the 2nd book to be released to see what happens,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved reading this story. It was smart, sexy and oh Andrew's filthy filthy mouth, can't help but I loved that. Can't wait to read the next episode!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsReasonable Doubt is a perfect example of a book I bought strictly because the book buzz. I didn't read any reviews. I just went with the buzz and saw it was only $1.00 on Amazon and did my favourite thing to do; Buy now with 1-click.I really really reaaaaalllly wish I had paid more attention because I didn't understand that Reasonable Doubt was a book serial. There are three novellas to be published (that is what I understand but could be wrong). Since Reasonable Doubt is a serial, the author ends this first book on a cliffhanger. I very much hate cliffhangers. So much so, I really don't care what happens in book 2. When this first book just ended abruptly as it did, I was just so mad that I decided it will just end for me. Besides, I got the jest of the story. I have to say, I'm not a fan.Although I didn't really like either character, I could not put this damn book down. They annoyed me and yet I wanted to read more about them. Andrew is a complete jerk. He treats women like crap and holds standards that don't make any sense. For instance, he hates liars yet he is a defense lawyer???? He gets furious when women don't use their real names when going on questionable dates or dating sites. Yet, what a shocker, he doesn't use his real name either.Aubrey is a complete liar. She is enrolled in law school AND at the same time trying to be a lead in the ballet Swan Lake. Not sure how that is possible. But back to her being a liar, she cheats and signs up to a &#34;lawyer only&#34; communication forum and pretends to be a full fledged lawyer and uses the other lawyer's free advice to pass through school. She lies about her age, who she is, her occupation and even what she looks like. Aubrey is really a 22 yr old law student and you can totally tell by her lack of maturity.I tell you, these two deserve each other. It was like a bad car accident. I couldn't look away.I did find their text messages back and forth humourous. Because they were a couple built on a tower of lies and deception, I kept on reading because I was dying to know how this all played out.When Andrew and Aubrey finally do meet and have their eventual sex, it was weird. Andrew was this dominate character, being extremely rude and very inappropriate for an office setting (especially when he is a partner). He treats her really bad and the fact that he is so attracted to Aubrey really angers him. He takes that anger out on her with cutting words and actions designed to hurt feelings. I have to say, the author Whitney Gracia Williams penned a relationship that I have never read before.Will I continue with the serial? No. I had enough in this first book. It was only $1 and it totally captivated my attention but not really my interest.",3
B00JDYC5OI,I found the link to this book on Facebook and I thought I would try it out and I am so glad I did. it is a great book wish it was longer and I can't wait for book 2!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I've been reading and reviewing amazing books lately. Books whose author pour their heart out. But in between, I feel like cleansing my palate with something delectable...in this case, delectably decadent! This read is short and sweet... although there is nothing sweet about Andrew Hamilton, whose mouth filters nothing (literally!). But I didn't end up disliking him, because he is the real thing. Both as a lawyer and as a, well, add the word. He never leads on and states upfront what he wants. If the girl is game, good. If not, she either spends the night in the 5* hotel suite, or gets a cab fare back home. Meeting Aubrey face to face makes him do a one-eighty, and he's baffled. Not that he treats her any better. In his mind, she's nothing but a liar, like the rest of them. But what was refreshing was Aubrey's reaction. She matched him word for word, defied him, called him names, stood her ground.My pet peeve in such books is that the heroine is your typical doormat: mesmerized by the all-consuming hero, she kneels in submission. I've developed low tolerance for such heroines, and frankly I don't understand what's so crazy appealing to female readers about situations like that. Well, that's not the case here, and I loved every minute of it.Don't get me started on the ending... I can't wait for the next episode, as I need to find out what Andrew's problem with women really is.",5
B00JDYC5OI,This is the first installment in this 3 part serial. This was a excellent start to this series. I really enjoyed it. I loved the characters and can't wait to find out what happens next.,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Quick and easy read. It's one of those books where I enjoy the sassy back and forth of the main characters. There is a definite heat and tension between the two. I am not thrilled that it is a serial. I would much rather read it all at once.This author is new to me, but I like her and plan to read more by her.",4
B00JDYC5OI,This was great I soo can not wait for book 2 and 3!!! The ending of this one left my mouth on the floor,5
B00JDYC5OI,Holy crap!  I just happened to come across this book. I've been in a real &#34;book slump&#34; lately and this just pulled me right out of it. Wow. I loved it from the very beginning. Do NOT pass by this one. Can not wait for #2!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"***5 Thoreau Stars***OMG..... Seriously I need BOOK 2 STAT!!!! How can you not love this novella... Hot sexy lawyer..Check.. Dirty talks..Check... Hot Sex...Check... Lies after Lies,...Check and a shocker for an ending..BIG FAT CHECK!!! Ummm...Ms. Whitney G., please don't make us wait too long for Book 2.. I need more Andrew and Aubrey!!!!!Andrew Hamilton is 32 years and a high profile lawyer. He is smart, sexy, and one hell of a dirty talker. He only has three simple rules to abide by when it comes to women: One Dinner, One Night. No Repeats. Also, another big NO NO NO for Andrew is that he hates LIARS. For him, once you lie...its sayonara! Simple as that!Andrew doesn't have many friends and the only one friend he considers is his Alyssa, who happens to be a 27 year old lawyer who has red hair and green eyes that he met on LawChat. For the past six months, they have been conversing over emails, text messages and on the phone. They have developed this flirtatious friendship. Alyssa would ask Andrew for legal advice on cases that she is working on. Through this ongoing friendship, Andrew makes it clear that he wants to meet her but Alyssa always avoids it.When Andrew and his partners are interviewing for new interns for the firm, a beautiful 22 year old comes walking into the board room. Aubrey is a junior at Duke University and interviewing for an internship. As they are conducting the interview, Andrew notices that answers Aubrey were giving were the same questions &#34;Alyssa&#34; was asking him. Putting two and two together, Andrew discovers his Alyssa is Aubrey. Lying is the number one thing Andrew despises. When Andrew finally clues Aubrey that he is aware of her lies, let the office madness and shenanigans begin.Reasonable Doubt is just WOW!! This quick steamy novella has me imploring for more...I need to know what happens next. This is my first read of Ms. Whitney Gracia Williams and I will definitely be checking out of her other books. The writing was exceptional. Dialogues were funny, witty, sexy and entertaining. And I adore the characters. Andrew was just oozing with sexiness and Aubrey/Alyssa was lovable. Holy hell...this short novella by Ms. Whitney has me begging for more. That ending....ugh!! I need you to hurry up, finish writing book 2 and hit publish!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was my first read by Ms. Williams and I absolutely loved it! I love when an author can make me like someone who I shouldn't and that was definitely the case with Thoreau. His behavior was often crude and vulgar, yet I couldn't wait to find out how he'd gotten that way. There was one teeny, tiny yeah-right moment but it was brief and didn't take away from the overall story. I can't wait to read the next part.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Nail biting, nerve wrecking start to a very good serial that is just gonna keep getting good!! Not to mention pretty damn steamy! Can't wait for episode 2!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This was the first book I've read by Whitney Gracia Williams and I loved it!  Andrew was such a jerk, but I liked him.  I loved his emails and text messages to Alyssa.  It's a fairly short story and you will want to start part 2 as soon as you finish part 1.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Saw all the 5 stars & positive reviews so I gave it a shot.  The premise is good but didn't like that she lied.  also, he really is a jerk.  The sex is hot but no real emotion with it. I am sure that will come later but he was a dick even in the sex scenes.  will read the next just to see where it goes.  also, not a fan of how short it was.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This is my first book by the author and she has a new fan. I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait for the next installment. I like the chemistry between Andrew and Aubrey, and that she is a little firecracker because I think Andrew needs that.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Holy crap, this novella sized book is one of the few books this year that had me instantly hooked from the very first line from the synopsis.This book is intense, the heat between &#34;Alyssa&#34; and Andrew is sizzling, their sexual chemistry is off the charts!I LOVE the book, even though it's short, it's filled with witty banter, great dialogue and some dirty talk ;) I devoured this book.This author has me hooked, how can one novella have that well written characters, story-line?!Mind = BLOWN.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"5 Smoking Hot Novella StarsFor ones I'm not disappointed I listened to all my Goodreads friends. My news feed was plastered with Reasonable Doubt reviews or status updates and I had to look it up -thank goodness did.The blurb had me right away; of course if you write something like that his 'lil' best friend has a huge female appetite *cough*. So yeah I clicked it and started it right away and oh my.... it was awesome in every way.The prologue gives as a glimpse why Andrew is how he is... something happened in his past -6 yrs ago - that made him turn on a switch and dating, relationships aren't on his agenda anymore.&#34;Every person I once considered a friend is now an enemy, and the word 'trust' has been ripped from my vocabulary.&#34; -We don't know what really happened, not yet, but that's the reason why his so busy burring his best friend in every woman he meets online.Andrew has a filthy and cocky mouth and I was cracking up; he was hilarious. He's a lawyer and he has only one friend, who he met in a lawyer chat -a woman named Alyssa. She isn't falling for his tricks and they both established a kind of friendship in the last 6 month -add the steamy telephone & email/text scenes in it too, because they weren't just talking business here ;)&#34;The only tool your p%ssy needs is my tongue. It's here whenever you want it, and it works in a &#34;VARIETY&#34; of ways.&#34; yeah but Alyssa refuses to meet him -nope, not gonna happen. She cherishes their friendship, despite that Andrew is seriously turning her on.Patience isn't something Andrew has so after long agonizing 6months he confronts Alyssa again,why they don't meet. He would even sleep with her more than once LOL. &#34;I'm tired of only being able to talk to you on the phone, Alyssa.... I need to see you... I need to [bang] you... I need to be buried deep inside of you...&#34; - yeah ladies this quote goes on a bit and holy heck he makes you swoon all over the place!Alyssa is affected by his words, his demands, and by the curiosity to meet him..&#34; 'You never made me cum...' 'Don't lie to me.''You haven't.' 'So,last week when I said that I wanted you to ride my mouth so I could eat your p@$sy until you came all over my lips, you were pretending to breathe hard?' &#34; &#60;-- seriously... this man.. it's hard not to scream at him saying YES YES YES I want to see you but Alyssa can't.Why you want to know?? Well, Andrew has a bit of a problem; something like a huge pet peeve: He despises liars, like literally hates them to the core, and Alyssa hasn't been fully honest with him...But read for yourself because it gets pretty heated between these two -in a good and negative way.Karma is a b!tch ladies, and soon they have a nice long meeting with her!I'm totally looking forward to read the second novella in this series. Whitney, you've a new fan!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I can NOT believe I finished this novella in less than 2 hours. I can NOT believe I would love this so much after just the first episode. Whitney G. where have you been my whole reading life? And why aren't you being spammed all over the internet like you deserve to be!Okay! Enough with my nonsense. The moment Whitney came to me with a summary of the book. I knew, I just knew, I would love every bit of the book. And Reasonable Doubt is undoubtedly my favorite read of the year! I love it so much, I hate myself for finishing it so quickly. Now, I have to wait weeks for the next episode to come out.In short simple words, everything about the book shouted PERFECTION to female bookworm brain. The writing style is beautiful, the transitions between scenes and characters was flawless. And finally, the characters are a blend of dark and light that makes them all the more intriguing in my eyes. Yea... I'm definitely not going to be able to wait for Episode Two! Whitney what have you done to me????",5
B00JDYC5OI,But this is a must read. I can't wait for the next one and I hope it is longer. When as t a great story and characters.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Love the chemistry between Andrew and Aubry. For someone who doesn't like liars Andrew sure has a lot of secrets he's not owning up to. Can't wait for the next book to delve into all of Andrews lies...I mean secrets.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I love these fast paced type of stories. Even though this one was short, too short I still loved every moment I read. I really didn't want this one to end. I love Aubrey's spunk and attitude, you don't see many female characters acting so strong like that. Andrew. Oh sweet and all that is holy, Andrew. He's to die for. Can't wait for episode 2. I want it now!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Great story line, very hot scenes in the book, intrigued to know what happens next! Really well written! Must read",5
B00JDYC5OI,Can't wait for part 2. A must read!!! This book will keep you wanting more and more!!!!  Worth every cent!,5
B00JDYC5OI,I love this book. The sex scenes were hot. I liked how smoothly the story rolled. The only thing I hate is how short the book is.,5
B00JDYC5OI,This was good. What started as a online discussion group for a supposed lawyer turns to a sexting sessions between two people  who have never met. Fate as a way of turn the tables and they meet. BUT not all is happy in the land of &#34;Oz&#34;. Lies were told and feelings are hurt. Maybe this isnt fate but karma?? Well we need to wait and see when the next installment comes out.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"So I am wiping the sweat from my brow with this one. It is start of a very hot series. The synopsis will make you click right away, I know it did me. This is a very short read, but packed with intense sexy dialog and a dirty mouth lawyer. I was completely invested and engaged in the story. I love the concept and I am amazed to feel so strongly about characters that I only had 78 pages to read. I will not go into the story I just want to tell you all that I loved it and I can&#8217;t wait for the next installment. It can&#8217;t come soon enough. Yes that last sentence has a double meaning!! Wink The ending left me wanting more.I also loved that it is priced right at $.99",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This book got me searching for other hot lawyer books to fill the void while I wait for this series to be completed. I love that I kinda hate the main character. I have not clue what the heck happened to him, but desperately want to know. There isn't a ton of actually steamy scenes in this book, yet the whole thing is scorching hot. His emotions are just so raw and hot. Love this author and hope to read much more from her!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"A great book with loads of steam factor. But Why a serial and not a novel?! Come on, stop torturing me.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Hate that this is short but it was a really good story that kept your attention until the end and beyond because you will be pissed at the cliffhanger!! Which I forgot or I would have waited for the next 2 books of the series before reading this one!!But it really is worth the read! I highly recommend this book!!Now, note to the author...get your butt in gear and get the next two books finished and hit publish!!! I can't wait forever to finish this story!!! I have to know what happens!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Please hurry on the second one! This was too short and left me completely hanging with eyes bucked and my jaw hitting the floor.  Needless to say, I loved this.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read where the story is going with Aubrey and Andrew.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I bought a tons of the books the other day and this was one of them. So late night I had just finished a book, and picked this one at whim didn't remember what it was about and started reading it, SO SO SO glad I did! I didn't know it was a short 78 pages until I reached the last page and was shocked at the last sentence and then realized there was no more, WHAT?? I want more of Andrew!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I love a fast, grab you from the first sentence read.  I also can't get enough of the POV!!I do hate the cliff hanger books, though--I'll gladly pay a full $9.99 for an entire book. . .",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Loved this book was so glad I had the second one on the kindle waiting on me. I love the connection that Aubrey and Andrew had. For some reason it reminded me briefly of 50 Shades. I think it was because see Aubrey was the only one he would let do certain things. Like ride in his car, stay at his apartment and send her flowers. Can't wait for the third one.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"What amazing sexy story. I enjoyed reading this book. This book was beyond amazing. The book was written as described, Sex and more sexual, Can't wait to read more of this author's books",5
B00JDYC5OI,Well written story about an alpha male playboy meeting his kryptonite. Give me more! I am waiting to see where the story takes them.,5
B00JDYC5OI,I LOVED it. I mean what was not to love. You have the male female leads the tantalizing text and phone calls. The meeting that was oh so good and the attraction that he couldn't deny. Looking forward to book 2&3 soon,5
B00JDYC5OI,"OK...I have found my new book boyfriend.Andrew Hamilton is just the kind if man that makes you swoon and get all hit & bothered.He's a major jerk and only does one night stands with women he meets thru online dating sites.His biggest turn off is a woman who lies.Maybe it's because he is an attorney? I think it's something else, much deeper but in this book, we're not given the insight.He meets a fellow lawyer, Alyssa, on some internet site for lawyers looking to network.Andrew breaks several of his rules for her.He actually becomes friends and they carry on with an online friendship for six months.He definitely is attracted to the girl he's been chatting online and on the phone with.His sexual innuendos and charm, however, are not convincing Alyssa to meet him in person.We will find out her secrets and so will Andrew.Get ready for fireworks and intense & sexy scenes with these two.It ends on a cliffy and I'm dying!!!I need book two like YESTERDAY!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Are you kidding me?! This really ended like THAT! Ahhhh! What a damn tease this was! I just want to say that I really dislike serial series. I hate cliffhangers. And I hate waiting. However, I really, really loved this very strong and sexy start to a fabulous new serial series that has me begging for more.In Reasonable Doubt: Volume One we meet Andrew Hamilton, a successful attorney. He&#8217;s sexy as hell. He&#8217;s a jerk. He&#8217;s a manwhore. He&#8217;s brazen. He&#8217;s snarky. He oozes sex. And I fell hard for him. MmmHmm&#8230; I just can&#8217;t help myself. There is something about a man that wears a suit with a successful career and a filthy mouth that gets me all kinds of hot and bothered.Andrew has one set of rules; one dinner, one night, no repeats. He has these rules for a reason. He doesn&#8217;t do relationships and refuses to build any kind of emotional attachment to anyone. Instead he meets women online for casual sex. He takes them out to dinner, has sex with them, and then moves on.Then he meets Alyssa in a lawyer&#8217;s only chat room. They form an unlikely friendship where they only talk on the phone and text, never meeting in person. They&#8217;re friendship is fun, flirty, full of snarky banter, and loaded with tons of sexual tension. Andrew may not have officially met Alyssa yet, he remains true to who he is on the phone and in his text messages.Eventually Andrew becomes intrigued by this woman, who goes by Alyssa on the phone. He wants to meet her but she refuses him every time he asks. Alyssa aka Aubrey has secrets. She&#8217;s not who Andrew thinks she is. And there is nothing Andrew hates more than liars. So when her secret comes out, he&#8217;s furious. But he can&#8217;t stop himself from being drawn to this woman. The only problem is that she makes him feel things he&#8217;s scared to feel.I adored Aubrey. She&#8217;s smart, witty, sexy, and not afraid to put Andrew in his place. Now that her secret is out in the open, the dynamic in their relationship has changed. There was sexual tension before but now there is sexual desire and a burning need to be with each other. And holy panty-melting hotness&#8230; these two are explosive together!Reasonable Doubt consumed me right from the beginning all the way to the heart-stopping cliffhanger. I was wooed and wowed and schmoozed by this unforgettable first episode that I&#8217;m still thinking about days later. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is witty and funny, and the storyline is smart and sexy. I absolutely recommend this serial series for anyone who loves a delicious alpha-hole, beautiful and smart heroine, addictive storyline, and an ending that will leave you salivating for more! And guess what? The second volume comes out on Thursday, April 17th!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Easy to read in one sitting. This was the first book l have read by Whitney G and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Wanted to slap Andrew a few times, but am really looking forward to learning why he is like he is. Never expected that ending.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was hooked after reading the first few pages. Hot, sexy and on edge waiting to see what was next. Best of all you got me good with the cliffhanger. Normally I hate them but this was perfect. I can't wait until book 2. Please hurry! I want to read it NOW! PLEASE!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a short, fast paced read. It builds to a very hot intense ending, keeping you on edge waiting until the second instalment of the three part series. Loved it.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Ok - I really really liked this book.  It has a &#34;Beautiful Bastard&#34; feel to it although it's not the same.  I like it.  I like that it makes no apologies.  The hotness starts right off the bat.  It makes no apologies and it's fast paced which I like.  I don't like the fact that it's a serial but I started it and I really liked so I'm going to continue reading.  Recommend it.,5
B00JDYC5OI,Whitney as usual does not disappoint. Another awesome story with HOT characters. Another great couple coming to life in so many ways. This beginning has just left me wanting to know what happens next. Waiting anxiously on pins and needles!!!!!!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was different. I cannot wait for the next book. I love passionate, angry men. Well done Whitney. You have not disappointed. :)",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Favorite quote: &#34;The cherry he'd picked up was in his mouth, and he was pressing it on my lips - silently commanding me to open up and eat it. I stuck out my tongue to take it, but before sliding it to me, he whispered, &#34;Don't chew... I want to see how capable you are of swallowing.&#34;I hate short books written in parts but this one sound interesting, so I took a chance and holey moley batman this book is hot. Andrew is an a** with a dirty mouth and knows how to use it. Aubrey doesn't know what hit her.  It has a CLIFFHANGER of course and I really need part 2 NOW!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"WOW, just wow. I have not read a book like this in awhile. The sexual chemistry, the banter between the characters, and the underlying issues both characters have added up to an amazingly scintillating afternoon of reading.Andrew is a lawyer without time for relationships but with a ravenous sexual appetite. His normal go to is a dating site and he never sees someone more than once. But on a lawyer site he meets someone that he becomes friends with over 6 months. While he truly enjoys just talking with her they definitely have chemistry, she just isn't willing to meet him.Aubrey is a pre-law student and she is needing help to get ready for an internship interview. She anonymously goes to a site and develops a relationship with Thoreau while getting help along the way. Things obviously go crazy once their paths collide and Andrew discovers the truth.This book was great but unfortunately it ends too quickly and with a major cliffhanger. I am dying here and I will be anxiously awaiting the next book. I am assuming this is a serial series since this says part one and typically I am not a fan of those, but for this one I definitely am making an exception.Definitely not a book to pass up on but perhaps best to wait til out in completion then you won't be sitting her waiting like me, anxiously awaiting the next.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I love this story the writing was truly amazing and the characters I can totally feel there hurt there struggles it was a really good writing for only .99$ can't wait for book 2 ....,4
B00JDYC5OI,"I usually wait for all the mini-episode-novella books to come out before I read them, because I'm pretty impatient so I don't want to frustrate myself.  I'm so glad I didn't wait on this series. It was written so well that it deserves to be read now not later.Now my only concern is to remember to watch for the next one, but with an ending like this one, that shouldn't be difficult.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"All I can say is WOW! I have absolutely no words for who and what Andrew is!!! On the surface you should dislike him, but I don't. I can't!!! I can't wait to read the rest of his story. This is a serial so don't start reading it and get all pissy about the none-ending but if you want to read about an alpha who is so over the top it's crazy - READ. THIS. You won't be disappointed.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Just wow!!! You will not be disappointed. A fairly quick read, also part of a series.Andrew Hamilton is one of the top attorneys in North Carolina. He's a broken man. He has secrets we don't know, yet. He's sexy as hell and only has one night stands. Andrew finds his &#34;dates&#34; on a dating web site. He hates liars, it's his one rule, no liars. He's very upfront with the women he dates. And he only has one friend, Alyssa, who he met on a legal website for attorneys only. They've been friends for some time now and have never met in person. Alyssa calls him when ever she needs help and he is all to eager to help a fellow colleague, or just chat with her.Audrey Everhart is a pre-law undergraduate trying to get ahead in her field.  She has been given an opportunity most people would love to have. She's a new intern at  Greenwood, Bach and Hamilton. Unfortunately, she's been moonlighting as the sweet lawyer Alyssa.When Andrew puts two and two together things get heated. Really heated!! There's super hot, up against the door, office sex. As well as some really heated discussions. I can't wait to read book 2!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I needed a reading break from writing today and was looking specifically for something quick that I could finish in a couple of hours. If you're looking for a quick, sexy, suspenseful read...I just finished Reasonable Doubt by Whitney Gracia Williams today. It's the first in a serial that will be released fairly close together. The story kept me interested every second and even though it ends in a cliffy...we won't have to wait long for the next one! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Andrew!!!!  OMG this book is HOT! I am dying here! I need book two stat! This is the first book I've read from this author and I definitely need to read more. Great story line so far and I'm eager to see what's next. Whitney I'm now a fan for life! Keep em coming and I'll keep reading!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG!!  I need more!!!  Like, right now!!!  I absolutely love this book!!!  Andrew is hot as hell.  I love this authors writing style.  She is engaging and interesting.  She grabbed me immediately and just sucked me right into the story.  Some writers just have that natural gift of writing that just flows effortlessly onto the page and she definitely has that gift.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"First, it must be said that I loved that this is a serial and it took me a little over an hour to devour the beginning of Andrew & Aubrey&#8217;s story. It hooked me from the beginning with the annoyingly handsome Andrew and his cockiness. He is a lawyer, and he plays the part well. He is very blunt, very forthcoming, and to the point. He seems to have a routine, especially when it comes to women, and very little was divulged about his past, which only makes him more intriguing. What happened to him? Why does he do what he does with the women he picks out online?He is mysterious, and yet loquacious. He strikes up a &#8216;friendship&#8217; with a woman he met through an online chat group. This friendship is the foundation to the story. He is very adamant about hating liars. He makes it VERY clear that liars have no place in his life. And yet, he gets caught into Aubrey&#8217;s web of deceit and can&#8217;t help himself.Aubrey is a beautiful, and young student/ballerina. She is determined and focused, trying to make it in the world of law; one her parents have dominated her whole life. She has little support and turns to Andrew for most of her problems. His support seems to thrill her as well as give her a sense of calm. She knows deceiving him is wrong, and yet she doesn&#8217;t stop.Their passion is off the charts hot. Andrew is very blunt, a true dirty talker. He is super sexy and makes Aubrey melt underneath him. I need more of this fabulous couple and their crazy antics. One minute their hot and the next cold&#8230;it&#8217;s way hot and plays so well from page to page. What an amazing start to a new series! I can&#8217;t wait for more REASONABLE DOUBT.~nicole",5
B00JDYC5OI,Even though this is a really short read I loved it.  I thought it was well played out and I am waiting patiently for the next two books to come out.  I can't wait!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I loved loved me some Andrew!!  He speaks his mind and it is dirty but man is it good.  Andrews character is blunt, forceful and so smoking hot.  I just want more.. I wish these authors wouldn't write these short stories unless they had them ready for release back to back.  I hate waiting.  I have to write them down because even though they are wonderful, once its been 6 months you forget to look for them.  This book is short but it is so sexy.  I can't wait for the next book.  I hope it doesn't take forever.  Definitely recommend this one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I love it. I can't give it enough stars. I devoured this book in like an hour... READ THIS!!!! &#60;3,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was swayed by all the five star reviews for this one but when I read it, I was not impressed.Entirely predictable and I have a pet hate of hidden identity in books so by the time these two finally meet face to face after six months of talking to each other every other day on the phone, they don't recognise each others voices? Admittedly Andrew realises after ten minutes or so but it just seemed ridiculous.I didn't find anything attractive about Andrew. The sex scenes weren't 'hot' and the cliffhanger was clich&eacute;d.I won't be reading the concluding parts.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"short book well for me anyways but it was smooth and evenly paced and then it just stop yeah there's a cliffhanger in the best possible way. Andrew is a hot the banter between the two in the beginning is funny and the little twist is a good one. whitney did it again, but she always does",5
B00JDYC5OI,I was just starting to get into the story and it was over. I hope I dont have to wait to long for the next one or it want be worth reading this series. Love both the characters of this story and hope the next book continues to develop them while keeping the interesting topic of this book flowing.,3
B00JDYC5OI,"I needed a quick light random read with some great naughtiness to it, since Scandal is only coming out a chapter at a time right now (Navessa Allen you are such a tease) and I needed a fix.Andrew is a womanizer to the extreme. Never more than a single night with the same woman and then onto the next one. The only long term relationship he has with a woman is someone he has only ever emailed and talked with on the phone. Audrey is all fun and games while she is playing Alyssa on the phone. They have a fun, flirty, dirty repoire and at this point I like them together, Andrew is going to get her to give in and finally meet him in person, until he accidentally meets her when she applies for an internship at his office and he finds out that Alyssa is Aubrey and she isn't anything he thought she was.There are some dirty scenes...more male oriented aggressive sex than emotional. Andrew has some sort of past issue and became a complete jackass. This isn't my favorite erotica since I'm more of a mutual respect, nice alpha male kind of girl but Andrew might be redeemable down the road.Not entirely my cup of tea but it is fast moving with interesting dialogue and the cliffy at the end totally intrigued me and I'll probably check out the next book.",3
B00JDYC5OI,Awesome new series but way too short. I hope the next two are longer and not a long wait.  As soon as I was really getting into it then it ended.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reasonable Doubt is part one of a three part serial...and I've never really read a serial before....and what an intense read it is! I gave it 5 stars, but I will wait to post my review after I've read all three books in the series. Intense is the word that kept coming to me...after my laugh out loud laughter in the beginning. Lies are a key theme in this one, but there is a deeper plot with so many secrets that are unfolding slowly.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"HOT, STEAMY, SEXY AND DRAMATIC ALL WRAPPED IN ONE!!!  I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!  PERFECT IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM!!! I wanted it to be a bit longer but that's what series is for!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,When you say a story will have a follow up please have the follow up when you say it will be available. Second this story was ridiculously familiar to another book I've read but with names changed. And third I wouldn't buy the next one but I'm OCD and when I read one I read all so there will be more not worth the one star I gave. Also you originally said rd2&3 would release within like a week of eachother why not release as a 2 for 1 price since it's already a day late ijs if you care for the fans prove it,1
B00JDYC5OI,A friend recommended this and I am so glad she did because I loved it! I can't wait for more! I think I had a smile on my face the entire time I was reading.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Fabulous read, great writing, interesting and unique storyline. Way too short and I can't wait for the next one to come out.",5
B00JDYC5OI,Damn I can't wait for the next to be released. I highly recommend you read this book!!! Hot & intense story you will very much ENJOY!,5
B00JDYC5OI,This book kept my interest. It made me squirm in my seat. Makes me impatient for the next book. You will not be sorry if you get this book!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out. Couldn't put this book down. Only compliant, it was too short. Hope book 2 is longer.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was blown away by the good writing in this book. Even if it would have been 10 times longer, I would not have been able to put it down. Can't WAIT for the next one! :)",5
B00JDYC5OI,I really wanted to like this book but just could not. i hate to say it but i hate reading a book where the story drags on and im spending 2.99 on a set of books for the same characters.,2
B00JDYC5OI,"Well, first off this book is only 78 pages so you can definitely read it in one sitting.I enjoyed the very quick read and it left me wanting more as it simply ended....with a surprise.Good start for a story but really I wished it was more than just the 78 pages because now I have to wait for the rest.  I would rather have the author provide a bit more than what was here.  I would have rather to wait for a more substantial book.  However, I will probably look for what happens next as this book was a good beginning.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Yi Yi Ya! Andrew Hamilton phew is hot sex on a stick! His controlling domineering ways over his online conquests will have you hooked line and sinker from front page to back!With his online help through a lawyer discussion group, new lawyer Alyssa hides behind her computer and phone with Andrew or should I say Thoreux, becoming her mentor!However overtime Andrew approaches of the idea for them to met to full fill his manly itch.With her repeated objection to meet, their lives cross paths in the most unimaginable ways! Secrets, lies and undeniable attraction, this brings the Story to a cliffhanger conclusion leaving you with I didn't see that coming!A fantastic beginning to what I cannot wait to see what further unfolds for these two!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was given this book for a honest review. I didn't think much about this book since it wasn't very long, but I was wrong. Williams doesn't take the story slow at all. She throws the reader in there feet first. It caught my attention right away and then ending left me wanting more. I can't wait for the next installment. A couple meets online one lies about everything about themselves while the other seemingly tells them the truth. When they run into each other by accident the result is worth the read!",4
B00JDYC5OI,I'm not a fan of serials because I get so caught up in the story and then it's done! I'm so impatient...this however was so good! I'm glad I gave it a try and I'm hooked! I can't wait for the next installment!,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Great book, can't wait for the next. Not crazy about cliffhangers, normally wait til they are all out now, but decided to bite the bullet on this one for some reason and I really loved it!! Bring on the next book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Whitney G whets our appetites by getting us all caught up in the legalities of this unconventional case, as we try to figure out the prosecutor or defense roles...or is it about family law? Either way we're left hanging as we await case resumption.  Whitney G the story and dialogue has sucked me in and has proven to be BOSS.  On with the second session already! Cant wait!!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Not for me, I started off  liking the story line, but it became almost ridiculous....really someone aspiring to become a prima ballerina and a lawyer at the same time is quite a stretch if not impossible.",2
B00JDYC5OI,"This was not what I was expecting but truly glad I took the chance on it!! This book was hot and I cannot wait to see what Andrew and Aubrey are getting up to in the next installment!!! Sex, office romps, secrets, lies and aN ex wife??? Can't wait!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Too short of a story...but I floved it!  The banter between Aubrey and Andrew had me laughing and the heat between them...hot!  Can't wait to read the next book and hopefully more stories from this author.  I let the way she writes...Very smooth flowing easy read.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I just finished Reasonable Doubt last night and I freaking loved it. You have no idea, NONE until u read it will you understand. Andrew (Aldo know as Thoreau) hates liars. Something happened 6 years before that which caused him to really despise liars. I don't blame the guy.  He chats with girls and is one and done if you know what I mean. At one point he meets Alyssa (also known as Aubrey) on a lawyer chatting site. Really only helping a colleague turns into a friendship that either one expected.  He wants to meet her, has to actually. He cannot stand it no more. But everyone lies no matter how small they are or the reasons behind it.  They both have lied to each other even though one knows it and the other doesn't. What happens when those lies are brought up out in the open?  Will they be forgive able?  You will have to read and see....Wow. I was hooked from the get go.  This story had it all. I'm was loving Andrew. I really feel for the guy Even though we really don't find out what happened it seems to me like we will eventually and I think that is what is really going to set the mood to the story. Same for Alyssa. I felt like we really didn't get into detail but I'm sure more is coming.Damn, Andrew is a hottie. He is sexy but what makes me love him is his take no crap honesty. One night with a girl, he is straight up with her. Even if she doesn't want to hear it, he's honest. Alyssa man I felt for the girl. At the beginning of the chatting session all she wanted was advice.  It turns into so much more  I can tell you that the chemistry between them what freaking hot!  No matter if through texts, phone calls or in person they were HOT!!!!  Seriously.One thing this book had going for it was that it wasn't predictable. I means it was but not where it really counts. The originality if the story was a plus. I like the authors whole spin on thus type if story.I cannot wait to read the next one and trust me I am sooooooo getting it the day it comes out, that's for sure!!Story 5Smut 5Overall 5Reviewed by Beggin from Mommys a Boom Whore",5
B00JDYC5OI,"HOLY ****! Is it possible to have a major book hangover after finishing a 78 page book? Reasonable Doubt was ridiculously good! It had superb writing, intense characters, and a cliffhanger that will have you pulling your hair out! I&#8217;ll be honest with you, I haven&#8217;t heard of this author until I started seeing this SEXY book cover all over social media. I have never 1-clicked an eBook so quickly in my life. After doing some research on Whitney G, I found out that this story is not only her first erotic romance, but her first serial. That amazes me to no end, because she rocked this book! She rocked the **** out of it.&#10077;&#8230;for a high profile lawyer, you have a pretty dirty mouth.&#10078;&#10077;You&#8217;d be surprised how much filthier it can get.&#10078;&#10077;Filthier than what I&#8217;ve already experienced?&#10078;&#10077;Much filthier.&#10078;COME ON!!! If you haven&#8217;t bought this yet, what are you waiting for?!?! Gorgeous, brooding, sexy, successful lawyer pines for a woman he hasn&#8217;t even met in person yet! Turns out this woman is not who she claims to be, but then again, you ARE talking about getting to know someone over the INTERNET! Wow!Andrew Hamilton&#8230;.get ready to swoon your panties off ladies! Mr. Hamilton is the book boyfriend to end all book boyfriends. This man is so intense, so sexy, so ****ing spectacular, that you will do anything for one night with him. And of course ladies, he is broken, and we all LOVE our broken men. We want to hold them, kiss them, **** them, and make it all better. Andrew despises liars. Something about his past relationship, has ruined him for the good women out in the world. His past has made him hard, made him unforgiving, and made him resentful. No woman can get close to him. It&#8217;s one night, and one night only, or you can **** off!&#10077;That&#8217;s when you and I are going to meet face to face, and I&#8217;m going to claim every inch of you.&#10078;There is something about the woman, Aubrey Everhart, or is it Alyssa, that flips his world inside out. Even though she deceived him, even though she did the one thing that he can&#8217;t forgive, he can&#8217;t stay away from her. There is this raw, intense chemistry between these two that will have you needing a cold shower. When Aubrey and Andrew are together, something snaps in the both of them. There is slamming up against walls&#8230;there is ripping of clothing&#8230;there is clawing at skin. It&#8217;s just down and dirty, revengeful, animalistic lust between the two. They will break their own rules to be claimed by one another.I have to warn you, that you will be so emerged in this story, that when the ending comes, you will not know what hits you. You will scream, you will slam your e-reader down, and you will curse up a storm. Well&#8230;maybe you won&#8217;t, but I sure as hell did! I&#8217;ve read plenty of serials, so I even knew it was coming, yet nothing will prepare you for this kind of ending! Luckily, we won&#8217;t have to wait long for Volume Two to get out our greedy, lustful hands. If I haven&#8217;t said it enough. GET THIS BOOK! It is the best $0.99 you will ever spend! It is guaranteed to have you wet in no time at all. YOU ARE WELCOME!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I love the characters in this book!  This book drew me in from the beggining and it left me wanting more.,5
B00JDYC5OI,I love these sexy mini series!  I loved the chemistry with the two characters.  The ending left me wanting more.  I'm all in with this series.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is an exceptional book. Well written, great plot and a frustrating cliff hanger. Can't wait to read what happens next.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG! All I have to say on this is HOT, HOT, HOT! Wow! He's a successful attorney and she's an intern. He left NY and everything behind after being lied too, so naturally he hates all liars.  They met online in a lawyers chat room and became friends until that one day of her interview with his company for an internship with his firm.  The story developed nicely and then the spice is nice. Fantastically nice.  Read it y'all. I'm moving on to book 2 now. I must know what happened after that cliff hanger!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Easy breezy fudging HOT! A sweet short read that leaves you breathless. Andrew loves sex. Who doesn't, right? His #1 rule ... don't lie. Will he break his own rule? A must read for the suspense.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Although this is a short read&#8230;. a few chapters&#8230; this story is definitely intriguing. I absolutely love Andrew. He&#8217;s a guy (clearly) and the dialogue doesn&#8217;t hold back on the male perspective, which I love. Its nice to have the male psyche in words as opposed to the usually *sigh* and over the top girly emotions we usually read in romance novels.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I LOVED IT!!!!! That's pretty much it...I absolutely fell in love with this story, I just one clicked it last night started it an hour ago and couldn't but it down. It had me from the first page! And OMG Andrew (lawyer) is HOT...I don't mean oh he's hot.....I mean he is super HOT...I think I've just contracted the love bug for lawyers....so move over MC novels (Wow I never thought I'd say that o_O)......but be warned peeps it is a cliffy...I usually try to stay away from them but after seeing some of the reviews my one click finger wouldn't let me pass this one up....I can't wait for the next installment! ~Chrissy~",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Strong characters! Lying has never been so sexy! Recommended read, I Loved the different points of view, the passion is palpable and exactly where it needs to be.....against the door, in an office! The book ended with just enough to not piss you off, and I'm looking very forward to the next read!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Great to start to this series.  You'll be hooked from the first page.There's a cliffhanger but you wont care the next book is coming very soon.Check it out.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"I read this quick one night. It's similar to BeautifulBastard, but the twist is different enough that I can't say it's a clone.So I guess Erotic Adult Serials are becoming the norm, now? Because this is realy more of a short story than a book. AND be warned it ends on a cliffhanger.Still, I was glued to the story the second I started. The author layers a lot of character development with very few words. Andrew is a jerk, but you can't help but like him. Aubrey is pretty stupid, but you kinda have to like her too.Overall Reasonable Doubt left me wanting more. Looking forward to the next one.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was just a teaser. The last page of book said all 3 will be out in April. I hope so, this one was good.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Captivating read. Hot sex scenes. Loved the bantering between the two leads. Even love Andrew's less than appealing, downright nasty personality. Can't wait for book 2!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Ok I will admit that I was very hesitant to buy this book even though it was only $0.99. It was so short (78 pages >.&lt;) that I figured I'd be frustrated as hell when I finished reading it. I was pleasantly surprised at what I found. Yes I am irritated but only because I now get to twiddle my thumbs and wait patiently for the next one (sigh). I have been sucked in yet again!Andrew hates liars. There is absolutely no excuse. Running from a previous betrayal in his life he makes up for it by having meaningless sex with random woman over and over again. His only rule is only one night.""One dinner. One night. No repeats.""Then he meets ""Alyssa"" on an online Lawyer-Chat. She insists they can only be friends. No meeting face to face. He wants her in his bed. After six months he is tired of waiting. Then they meet in the last place they would ever imagine.She lied......but so did he.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I was so not ready for the book to end, I devoured it in one sitting.  I will warn you though, it's part of a series and the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger.  It came highly recommended by bloggers and friends, and I agree with all their prodding to read it.I thought the chemistry between Aubrey/Alyssa and Andrew/Thoreau was amazing and so sexy.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Can't wait for next book. I love books about the law, so the book captured my attention right away. Patiently waiting.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I did like it indeed but it was too short! It's unnerving because I have to wait for the second installment and I think the author could have made it in one book! It's not like it's 500 pages or so. So what?GRRRR, frustrated reader here!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Well, Whitney has done it again!This is a steaming hot novella (#1 in a 3 part series) and it ends on a major cliff hanger that I certainly didn't see coming, but has left me desperate for the next installment.Andrew Hamilton is a sexy hot shot lawyer, his moto - &#34;One dinner. One night. No repeats.&#34; That is until he connects with Alyssa aka Aubrey, online. Their cyber relationship is based on lies, and when Aubrey turns up to interview as an intern at Andrew's law firm, their identities are realised, and things start to get very heated, in more ways than one.This very short read had me tearing up which surprised me a little. I felt sorry for Aubrey, although she is a firey and sassy girl and can definitely look out for herself, but I could also sense her vulnerability coming through.A brilliant read once again from Whitney, and I can't wait to get stuck into the next part of Andrew and Aubrey's story, where I am very sure the best is yet to come.*Arc received in exchange for an honest review*",5
B00JDYC5OI,I loved the characters there relationship was really interesting. I do love that these books are short gives you just enough information to keep you hanging on,4
B00JDYC5OI,I don't know why I didn't read this sooner! Great quick read but if you don't like cliffys stay away or buy RD2!,4
B00JDYC5OI,"Part 1: Reasonable DoubtPart 2: Reasonable Doubt IIPart 3: Reasonable Doubt IIIReasonable Doubt (part 1) is man-whore extraordinaire, attorney and law firm partner, Andrew Hamilton&#8217;s story.  It follows him six years after gut-wrenching betrayal that forced him away from his previous life, details to be unfolding with story.  He has settled into a comfortable life of practicing law and his free time spent on the various internet dating sites for his next one-night-stand.&#8220;This is always the most annoying part, the part when the woman who previously agreed to &#8220;One dinner. One night. No repeats.&#8221; wants to establish some type of imaginary connection.&#8221;For the past six months he has been offering legal advice to Alyssa, a young new lawyer in his city and, though they never met, they have formed a friendship of sorts.  Though she doesn&#8217;t want to meet him and insists on being unattractive part of him still wants to hit it, just once&#8230;&#8220;I&#8217;ve never f****d one of my friends before.&#8221;&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m your only one.&#8221;Then upon sitting in at the final interviews, for the coveted intern position at his firm, he meets a young attractive pre-law student, Aubrey Everhart.  And yet again he discovers he has been deceived&#8230;.Reasonable Doubt will follow Andrew in his somewhat UN-reasonable reaction to the unraveling of he is perfectly organized and carnal existence providing for off-the-charts sex and a chance of a glimpse of his infamous c**k.ANDREW HAMILTON: 32 years/attorney/partner at Greenwood Bach & Hamilton/$$$$/dark brown hair/blue eyes.Seven words to describe Andrew: Charismatic, jaded, flawed, commanding, enigmatic, vulnerable and larger-than-life.&#8220;I immediately clicked on my profile and opened the &#8220;What I&#8217;m Looking For&#8221; box, making sure that it still read the same: &#8220;Casual sex.

Nothing Less.&#8221;AUBREY EVERHART: 22 years/pre-law student/blond hair/blue eyes/ballerina.Seven words to describe Aubrey Everhart: Smart, nave, endearing, focused, lonely, impressionable and resilient.Reasonable Doubt was the perfect read for me. Both Andrew and Aubrey might have been a little slow at catching on to the truth, but that&#8217;s how it needed to be. Story moved along at a fast pace only to come to a shocking mother-of-all cliffys ending.  Thankfully part 2: Reasonable Doubt II should be out shortly! [wipes sweat!]Excellent story-telling!

B00JDYC5OI,"I Don't usually do reviews but this story was so exciting.  Aubrey was time enough for Andrew. I loved their chemistry together, can't wait for the next two books.  Bring it on :)",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I liked it! Can't wait for the second part of the story. Very different in that you will have moments when you say, 'Oh, no, he didn't say that!&#34; I don't usually read a novella, but this was a very good story.....try it. You'll like it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Whitney has done it again! I love all of her books and this one was no different. I really appreciate her writing style and the story she gives to all of her work. Each is unique and different and each has me glued to my e-reader, for sure. This book was more steamy, in a good way. I wanted to hate Andrew for the lies and his arrogance but... I guess we will find out more as this serial progresses. Cannot wait until the next book! Sexy, hot, steamy and a great read!! Absolutely loved it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I don't normally do series; I would rather just have the full edition of a book, but this was a good read.The author did a great job on the story and the dialogue between characters. I will be reading the next in the series. Though I doubt that I would read a series from another author; this author has me hooked. Note that this is a short read; but a very enjoyable read.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Very quick read that is clearly setting up a series that, because of the length of the books, could likely have just been one longer novel.  Plenty of heat, and enough story to keep you interested.  Off to see if the rest of the story is available.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"Ah Geez what can I say.. this good girl just loves her filthy dirty bad boy Thoreau! And Good Lord I love Andrew's scandalous playboy ways just as much. Oh wait they are the same hunk-o-lusciousness. There is some sort of secret of his past that's shrouded in mystery and I can't wait to tear all his protective walls down.Alyssa or Aubrey or whoever this little intern or ballerina wants to be called is fine by me. Her innocence and sweetness is going to be wrecked in the worst way by Mr. Hamilton, yet her smart mouth get in the way at the best of times. Its going to be so fun to see him tame her or her settle him down.This Highly charged Courtroom drama filled novella is absolutely beyond the normal erotic around, so much so that its highly anticipated Book 2 is where I'm headed next! Wish me luck I'm going in...Thank You Whitney Gracia Williams!",5
B00JDYC5OI,Where is the rest of this book? This was basically a short story. Now we have to wait for two more books. It wasn't good enough to warrant two more books. I got sucked in by the description. Don't be fooled.,1
B00JDYC5OI,Loved loved this story! I cannot wait for the next book.......you must read this book!!!! It was awesome and hot. There is no doubt in my mind.......this  is a winner!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a pleasant surprise - Aubrey was clever and Andrew was captivating, and their chemistry is explosive! I can't wait for more. I have read Mid-Life Love, and enjoyed it but this was so much more interesting - the plot is more gripping! Anxiously awaiting the next part Whit;)",4
B00JDYC5OI,Whitney grabbed a hold of my attention Nd kept it through the entire story!! Fat has a way.intervening when you least expect!! This book was.recommended by a friend and I was hooked!!

I LAUGHED READING THIS BOOK AND GOT &#34;HOT&#34; READING THIS BOOK...I CANT WAIT FOR PART 2&3 AND WILL SEND ALL MY FRIENDS TO THIS AUTHOR TO GET MORE BOOKS!!!!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was  shorter book which was fun. It was well written and flowed really well. I loved the vibe, and story. Hot attorney, doesn't like liars, doesn't have friends just hooks up with chicks off the internet, until he meets Alyssa. Well she isn't who she says she is. He doesn't like liars, but they have crazy chemistry and I need book 2! Totally worth the read!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I didn't care for the main character. Self centered men are an instant turn off to me and most women that I know. The fact that the female in the book stuck around as long as she did and put up with him just made me hate it even more. The writing was good, but that was the only thing saving me from not giving this a one star review. I have to connect to the characters, and I just couldn't in this one. A shallow, self centered man that just wants sex and nothing more is not for me. Maybe some women like being treated that way. I guess I'm a rare exception.",2
B00JDYC5OI,"NO! I don&#8217;t want it to be over! I need more! ASAP! This is one heck of a novella. You got a compelling story, superb writing, and some seriously sexy scenes. I loved both Aubrey and Andrew and their crazy hot chemistry. This book took me all of an hour to read but I loved every minute of it! And then that killer cliff has me begging for the next installment!",5
B00JDYC5OI,I. LOVE. THIS. BOOK OMG he is so freaking hot I want him LOL. He is such buthole UGH. The sex was so hot. He can get it. Thanks Whit can't wait till the next one please hurry make it longer please.,5
B00JDYC5OI,The story was really good.  I loved the emotion between the two characters.  I'm definitely reading the next book for sure.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reasonable Doubt gives us the short and steamy story of Andrew and Aubrey. These two are a match made in heaven. Having been burned in the past by reasons we still don't know, Andrew has a rule one night rule with all women. He has very little personal relationships with anyone but the illustrious &#34;Alyssa&#34; with whom he's created a sexually fun friendship with only via the phone and internet. The curiosity this dynamic builds for the reader totally satisfies. There's a slow burn happening and the anticipation makes for a fun reading experience. And, &#34;Alyssa&#34; matches Andrew blow for blow in funny snark and charming banter. Her character has secrets that we are privileged to know but Andrew is not. She's a total spitfire with him and I adored the fight in her. Both characters are charismatic and engaging. When &#34;Alyssa&#34; commits the ultimate betrayal in Andrew's eyes, flaming hot sparks ignite from the slow burning fire they've been slowly stoking. Even though Reasonable Doubt is a novella and quite short, it packs a mean punch. I'm excited to read the next installment to get more of these characters especially after that ending. Gah!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This is a fun, sexy read.  It's part one of a serial so it's very short but for the $.99 price tag worth it.  The H is drop dead gorgeous, smart, and sarcastically funny.  The h is beautiful, smart and warm.  This was probably inspired by FSOG as it is very similar in plot and feel so far but in this instance it works.  I am looking forward to the next installment.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I happily give this 4  stars and can&#8217;t wait for more.You know the anticipation you feel when the story builds with our sexy and super dominant alpha, you know, when he&#8217;s annoyed with the leading lady because she&#8217;s been a naughty girl, so he turns her into a quivering mess of need and you guessed it anticipation.Well I suspect that is how you&#8217;ll feel when you finish Reasonable Doubt by Whitney Gracia. I want to start with the fact that this book ends in a cliffhanger. Before you begin to grown and complain like SO MANY do. I want to say isn&#8217;t it the books that end in cliffhangers the ones that stay with us? This is a serial, advertised in the synopsis in fact, so we are forewarned.  I don&#8217;t mind novellas or serials. I have one stipulation. The author MUST develop the characters and enough of the story line. Now many authors have begun writing novellas and serials and ending the story. To me they fail to develop enough of the story line and they fail drastically to development the characters. When this happens I don&#8217;t care how much sex you throw in, it&#8217;s just not enough! In my opinion Whitney Gracia did not fail me or her readers. She delivered characters that are unique and interesting. Luckily the cliffy is not to bad that I&#8217;m left in an agonizing wait, but good enough that I want more!Reasonable Doubt has left me panting for more. I found it steamy, and intriguing. I loved/hated Andrew instantly. Call me crazy but I prefer a love hate relationship with my alpha. And that&#8217;s what I got! I was immediately charmed by Whitney&#8217;s storytelling. Our introduction to Andrew was flawless and gave me exactly what I desired. The story flowed, developed and kept reminding me that I should really make my husband &#8220;hang&#8221; around more, or I should take COLD showers frequently. This story goes from a strike of a match to a bonfire almost instantly and I loved every minute. If consider yourself delicate and innocent in the ways of dirty talk, than Reasonable Doubt will give you a lesson that you are not likely to forget.The nonchalance bad boy attitude emitted by Andrew, mixed with his smooth talking dirty mouth has me impatiently waiting for more",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Something new, different and HOT!! I'm hooked!!! Love Andrew and his rules make him so lust worthy!!! The subtle secrets just add that something extra!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"HOLY HOTNESS! THIS BOOK! - I literally stumbled across this one as I was one-clicking another. I saw the cover and the 5 STARS underneath and thought to myself &#8220;well what do we have here?&#8221;BEST. DECISION. EVER!This is not a novel. It&#8217;s an approximate 78 page novella, it costs 99c and it should be on everyones e-reader. I was never one to just pick up a short story. I love a book I can bury myself into on a cold rainy day. But this one needs to be the exception.Reasonable Doubt was one of the HOTTEST reads I have read in a really really long time. It&#8217;s quick, laugh out loud funny, sexy as all hell and has left me begging for part II.&#8220;Is there super-glue on my floor? Is that why you&#8217;re still standing there?&#8221;Andrew Hamilton is addicted to sex. He has it with a different woman every time. No repeats.

Then she turns up at an interview at his law firm, not knowing it&#8217;s his, and then this is when the story gets even hotter!I could not get enough of Andrew Hamilton. This cocky, selfish, successful, filthy mouthed, stubborn, sexy SOB has me completely addicted and oh my god I need more!!This book is FILLED with hot sex, lies, secrets, hot sex, lots of dirty talk and did I mention the hot sex?Absolutely LOVED it.Can&#8217;t wait for more!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"You might need to take a cold shower after this one, but perhaps the twist ending and the nagging feeling that Andrew has more secrets than Skulls and Bones will cool your ardor enough to focus on the plot.  I love it when a story jumps off the page, digs its claws in and takes you on ride of which you never imagined and this new series from Williams has got me hook, line and sinker. Reasonable Doubt is part online hookup with a side of law review and I can&#8217;t wait to 1-click and repeat for the next installment.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I liked this alot and went straight to #2 and am waiting not so patiently for #3.  I wish this was one whole book because these little teasers are killing me!,5
B00JDYC5OI,WHAT A READ!!! OMG I love this book I cannot wait for the second part of it. Well written and super SEXY!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Dang, Andrew starts off as and ass and doesn't let up for the entire book.  This is a guy with some major trust issues that he makes clear the minute he meets somebody.Andrew is starting over in a new town at a new job.  We aren't privy to his past just yet, so we have to go with the flow with what he has going on now.  Andrew is a lawyer and uses online dating sites to meet women, however he isn't looking for a girlfriend, just a good roll in the hay.  After a few losers in a row, Andrew starts chatting it up with a girl on a lawyers only site.Aubrey is making her way through law school and falsely making her way on to the lawyers only site.  She hooks up with Andrew and over the next few months he helps her out with some legal questions. Andrew wants to meet after a bit and she is reluctant.  Aubrey's profile is a fake, but her feelings for Andrew are not.This is the first book in a series, it is very sexy and of course has that cliffhanger ending.  It is mainly told through the eyes of Andrew and I feel that is what made it stand out for me.  Great book, well written and I can't wait for the next one!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Nice, quick read! I am getting frustrated though with all these series coming out! I wished it were a full novel!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"This book just got put in my top ten favorites,wow!! I read it one day,couldn't put it down,lovable characters,can't wait to read Whitney's other books,I need to read book 2,",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this. The writing is smooth, flawless and really draws you in. There is just something very sexy about Andrew that makes you want to learn more about him and get into his head. Both him and Aubrey are very likable characters and it's easy to enjoy both of their POV's. I would recommend this serial if you're looking for a short, HOT read that will keep you wanting more AND there will be more. RD2 just came out a few days ago and RD3 will follow soon.LOVED RD and I know you all will too.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"This was a very fast paced, delightfully sexy read! I can't wait for the next installment! &#60;3 Andrew's dirty mouth.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Well damn!!Ok this was a relatively quick read, but that didn't take away from how awesome this book is! My only problem with it was I read it...and I really really need the next part...like this morning when I finished this one!I NEED MORE!! I NEED MORE!! I NEED MORE!! *stamping feet hoping it will hurry the next part up*",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Visit my profile for a full, unedited review.The book is good but very short. I read it in approximately an hour and then read the 2nd book immediately following in under 45 minutes. Because of that shortness and some of the abruptness of the cliffhangers at the end, I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5.However, they are very well written, engaging, and smokin' hot.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Well this was some straight up book candy! Sexy,funny and surprising. Read the blurb it says it all.Sexy fun with a .99 price tag? What's not to like? Well....it's a short 78 pages and there will be a part two coming soon. I didn't see a date for that though. As part of that ongoing trend of &#34;hook, line and sinker&#34; You know. Give me a little, suck me in and make we wait for the rest with a cliff hanger at the end. I get irritated.Don't get me wrong. IT&#34;S GOOD.REALLY GOOD. I just wish I could get it all in one book and not a bunch of short stories.T~",4
B00JDYC5OI,If your looking for a fast hot read this is perfect!!  The ONLY thing disappointing about this book is how short it is and it ended!!  I'll be one clicking the next book as soon as it goes live!!  Loved Andrew and Aubrey's emails and text.  And man way to go out with a bang!!  I need more Andrew!!!!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"~Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogThis was a complete surprise for me.  I stumbled across this book and I was immediately sold on the cover and the blurb.  But I admit I was a bit scared that I would get another &#8220;rich boy&#8221; (wasn&#8217;t sure if he was a billionaire) book.  At the moment, I&#8217;ve had an overload of those.REASONABLE DOUBT is a bit far-fetched but highly entertaining story.  Once I started, I really couldn&#8217;t help but be completely involved in the story and want to see it through &#8217;til the end.  And yes, knowing this is sort of considered a serial being that the story continues over a series of novellas, I was expecting that end to come soon.  Even so, it felt as if it had a good length.But lets get back to the story.  Andrew is a complete jerk.  Emotionally unavailable.  Completely drool-worthy.  Successful, hot and with numerous &#8220;assets&#8221;.  He likes sex and he gets it often, never from the same woman twice.  He finds his dates online and never shares personal information with them, nor any more time than needed to find his release.  Until he develops a friendship, his one and only, with a mysterious woman.  As much as he wants to meet her, she doesn&#8217;t agree.I&#8217;m not usually a fan of jerks, although at times they have some appeal.  And for some reason, Andrew aka Thoreau had that appeal.  Even though at time my jaw would hit the floor about some of the things he would say, but I can see how someone would keep coming back for more! LOLAubrey started out very likeable for me but when things changed between them I feel like her confidence faltered just a bit.  I hope she doesn&#8217;t turn into a typical young heroine.  I like her being feisty and I hope she stays like that!  One thing is for sure, these two have great chemistry!I hope that the next installment in this serial brings the same appeal for me and I can&#8217;t wait for more Andrew.",4
B00JDYC5OI,"I really read too fast to work with stories in part mode unless the rest is there fairly quickly, (reading addict, both good and bad, I read fast and often, so probably buy more, but then I really get disappointed if the follow up is substandard, I loved the other novella written by the same author, and I loved the first part of this, and it has a really good twist/cliff hanger, but frustrating that I can't find out what the author has in mind to resolve the issue, ie what happens. So the big question is, will I care by the time the follow up is ready. Maybe, I re-read several times usually, just depends if something comes along more intriguing.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"Yes, you got my attention and I need to read more about Andrew and Aubrey.  Through the fore play and phone sex these two characters keep the story line alive. Can't wait, looking forward to the second book",5
B00JDYC5OI,I couldn't put this book down!!! Major cliff hanger!! i can't wait for the next book in the series!! Serious book hangover!,5
B00JDYC5OI,This is pure erotic lust.  I should have known after reading the synopsis / summary but for some reason I thought it would be a case of womanizer meets woman who consumes him.  I thought he would be a possessive alpha male.  Instead Andrew is a mean condescending unemotional jerk.  And naive Aubrey lets him have her whenever and wherever he wants.  It has nothing to do with love.  I will not continue to part two.,2
B00JDYC5OI,"Very well written and very enticing story. I will defo be reading the rest of this authors works, beginning with the sequel to this book.",5
B00JDYC5OI,"OMG! I'd throw on my best poker face and lie like never before just to have Andrew Hamilton trap me with his body against a wall.I new going into this book that it was only 78pgs. and had a feeling I'd be left hanging, but holy smokes was it worth it.Aubrey is a firecracker who can definitely hold her own. I love her sass and her overall character.Andrew...oh!!! Andrew is honest personified. He's deep though, with a past that is still so entrenched in mystery. There's something behind Andrew that heartbeats at you to be the one he turns to.Lucky Aubrey for getting even a small part of him, no matter his own regrets on the issue.",5
B00JDYC5OI,I'm ready for the next installment now...  I was on the edge of my seat heart beating fast thru this whole story!!!  Loved loved loved it!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Reasonable Doubt begins with Andrew showing us his routine for the last six years. Meet someone online, talk to them for a week, then sleep them and never speak to them again. It's what he does after something bad happening to him six years ago. He seriously hates lairs and this is the best way to keep away from a relationship. Until he meets Alyssa. She actually becomes his friend, until he finds out who she really is. Then things start to change for both of them.I liked this book, but I seriously didn't like the ending. I know it is part one of a three part series, but seriously that ending was a major cliffhanger and it bugged me. Other than that I really enjoyed the story for the most part. I wish there was a little bit more information about Andrew but I feel we will learn more in the next book.",3
B00JDYC5OI,"Yes, it's a short read, but that's why it's 99 cents! It was the perfect, quick diversion for a Sunday afternoon. Even when I knew what was going on, I had to keep going to see what would happen next. Can't wait to see how the series plays out!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"I went in knowing that Reasonable Doubt was short, but I'm still bummed out that it wasn't longer. Because that ending was unexpected and shocking! And while it was a quick read, it was hot and kept me entertained. I'm looking forward to reading part two, and I hope the wait isn't too long!",4
B00JDYC5OI,"Wow! something new and different from all the plot we've been reading lately. This is written from the pov of Andrew, a very outspoken, cocky and extremely handsome lawyer who joined on line dating. He's very direct and explicit in what he's looking for in his profile which is sex, no more, no less but just sex. He spares no ones feelings when it comes to saying what he wants and what he dislikes. He hates liars, he dislikes women who are clingy and harbors hope that a relationship will form after having sex with him. He's funny but brutal at the same time, he has no problem fending off women who aggressively flaunt themselves to him. Boy, can he set them down and drive them running the other direction. I love this man, he may seem a man-whore but he has his own set of standards and he follows his own rules...never to sleep twice with the same woman, no sleeping over, no pillow talk after sex but wow, can he give the best sex ever! This is so hot, so provocative, enticing and real sexy you have to read it!",5
B00JDYC5OI,"REASONABLE DOUBT (REASONABLE DOUBT VOL. 1) by WHITNEY G.This serial is one of the hottest I have read and I want more. And also my first from Whitney G & she nailed it! Serials are starting to climb up the charts nowadays and I love it! I think there's so much room for you to play in making a serial and there's so much possibility.Reasonable Doubt is truly a hot & short read. It will also shock you. A good kind of shock, I hope. I cannot wait to read the next installment. I bet it will be hotter than this and can't to know more about Andrew's life. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!** Also posted on my TUMBLR & GR account",4
B00JDYC5OI,I love you Andrew you are my number one book boyfriend!!!! This book is amazing the chemistry between the characters are off the hook I so recommend this book it's worth the time to read you will enjoy!!! Happy reading!!!,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Well, I liked the whole idea of the book the plot was good and its engaging but..Why oh why do authors do this. Why not write a full book and not just 100 pages. I would rather pay more for a good full length book than 99 cents for not even half a story!!!!!!I probably won't continue the &#34;series&#34; but that's just my opinion.",2
B00JDYC5OI,Love love love Andrew. It was a little to short so of course I'm dying for the next book but still an awesome read.,5
B00JDYC5OI,"Serial's have quickly become more and more popular lately. Not all can manage to fully construct a complete storyline in such a little amount of pages. Fortunately, this first installment of Reasonable Doubt is wonderfully built to fulfill the reader's every necessity.Andrew Hamilton is prime attorney and partner of a top law firm. He has some issues from being burned in his past. We get to see his demons and lifestyle from the start of the book. As much as I wanted to hate him -and should hate him- I just couldn't help but fan myself from the lusty feels I received from him.It's routine for Andrew to browse a dating site and take his pick of hookups. No real names, no cuddling or overnight stay; just a one time thing.Aubrey Everhart is a pre-law major following in the footsteps of many members of her family. However, her passion is dance. Her dream is to become a professional ballerina. The only person she can talk to, her only true friend, doesn't even know the real Aubrey. They've never met and have only spoken to each other over the internet and phone. He's there whenever she needs him and vice versa.Andrew and Aubrey's lives collide and secrets are revealed. That's when things really begin to heat up.I was surprised to see how much character development occurred in just this first book. I really felt like I knew Aubrey's situation well and her internal struggles allowed me to connect with her. Not much is know about Andrew, but the little bit that is opens up a path of intrigue.The majority of this book has Andrew and Aubrey distant from each other, yet the chemistry is still at the highest levels. Once they do meet, the heat skyrockets and sets us up for the rest of the series. Being a serial, I knew there would be a cliffhanger, but I was left with my mouth hanging open. I think I was so distracted by the Andrew and Aubrey sexiness, that I never saw thought it would end the way it did.High five to Whitney for sweeping the rug out from under me! Whitney Gracia Williams really outdid herself with her first erotic romance serial. Really looking forward to reading the second part of this series.",5
B00JDYC5OI,This was really good. Excellent! Very short though.  I can't wait for the next one!! Hurry!! I couldn't put this one down...,5
